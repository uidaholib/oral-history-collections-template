    "description": "Ritualized festivals in Francophone Belgium (Wallonia) are central to civic pride and historical commemoration. Many saint-military marches, featuring hundreds in Napoleonic-era uniforms escorting a saint statue, received UNESCO recognition in 2012 as 'Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.' These processions often involve families with generations of participation. Binche is famous for its Carnival, featuring les Gilles—masked men with ostrich plume headdresses. In Mons and Ath, saint processions evolved into large-scale celebrations: Mons' festival includes mock combat with a dragon, while Ath’s features giant statues. The Carnival of Binche (2003), Le Doudou of Mons (2005), and La Ducasse of Ath (2005) all hold UNESCO recognition. These traditions, dating back to the late medieval period, ceased during the French Revolution but were revived in the 19th century. This talk explores their reinvention, 20th-century evolution, and their role in modern community identity.
