Said we need the right to vote as a means to an end. We need to stop. You know, we need to enact prohibition. And to do that, we need the vote. And then Abigail Scott Dunaway, who was another one of these, like, individualists, you know, strong willed, very well-spoken women.",

You know, so I think it's interesting to see how all that strategy really played out into how Idaho really approached it.",

    "description": "This presentation will explore the circumstances that allowed for the development of womenâ€™s clubs in the United States between the early 1800s and early 1900s and the underlying ideologies and sentiments that spurred the growth of activism and organizing during Progressive Era. With this foundation the presentation will then explore the emergence of womenâ€™s clubs in Idaho, the specific work of these clubs, and the impact that these clubs had in their communities. The work of club women at the turn of the century supported various facets of the community, including health, education, the arts and humanities, and political and civic engagement. The presentation will end with an exploration of how some of these clubs adapted and continued to serve their community well into the 20th and 21st centuries, and how, thanks to the record keeping of these organizations, we (with the help of historians) can learn from the women leaders of the past.
