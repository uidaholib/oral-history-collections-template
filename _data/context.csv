In part two (What), we will explore different ways of using Blue Humanities in the classroom, including examples of semester-long courses (from both scientific and literary perspectives) and shorter units. The final section (How) involves looking at several literary works and thinking about their different approaches to rivers and the concept of “home.”",humanities; rivers; literature; humanities; hope; education,Dr. T.S.

These projects displaced towns, tribal communities, farms, and ranches along the Snake, Colorado, and Columbia Rivers. The Atlas of Drowned Towns (drownedtowns.com) is a multimedia public history project dedicated to recovering these lost histories.

This was the fate of many early Native American materials, to be appropriated by non-Natives and removed from the hands and lands that created them. The shirts, dresses, baskets, horse regalia, and more—called the Wetxuuwíitin’ (formerly Spalding-Allen) Collection—would not return to their rightful home until they were purchased by the tribe from the Ohio Historical Society in 1996 for $608,100. On November 23rd, 2021, the Ohio History Connection (formerly the Ohio Historical Society) returned $608,100 to the Nez Perce Tribe. Burt Logan of the OHC stated that if the collection was “in the possession of the Ohio History Connection today, we would freely return these items to their rightful home.” The reclamation of these Nez Perce artifacts is the subject of a new WSU Press book, “Coming Home to Nez Perce Country,” published in June 2021.

context_70,S2E16 The End of the Cold War and American Culture,2021-10-19,Idaho Humanities Council,"The Berlin Wall, Polish Solidarity, Tiananmen Square, the dissolution of the Soviet Union: the end of the Cold War created cultural and political reverberations around the globe. Americans celebrated the United States’ triumph over the Soviet Union, having “won” a conflict that had dominated international affairs for half a century. Yet the end of the Cold War wrought changes in American culture that are sometimes difficult to trace, especially in comparison to the waves of revolution and mass demonstration that characterized other parts of the world between 1989 and 1991. This talk will explore some of the subtle ways that the end of the Cold War influenced American culture, many aspects of which have only become apparent in the three decades since. I contend that the experience of the 1980s and 1990s not only helps us understand American culture in the era since September 11, 2001, but also lends insight into the lasting influence of these decades in American culture today, from pop culture to politics. Bio: Dr. Sarah Robey is Assistant Professor of History at Idaho State University, where she teaches courses in American history, the history of the Cold War, the history of science and technology, and the history of energy. Her research focuses on the intersection of American culture and public life and the history of nuclear science and technology. Her first book, Atomic Americans: Citizens in a Nuclear State, will be published with Cornell University Press in early 2022. She also has a forthcoming chapter in Energy Cinema (West Virginia University Press, 2022), which explores how popular entertainment served as public nuclear education in the early Cold War.

context_72,S2E14 The Life of John Denver,2021-09-27,Idaho Humanities Council,"John Denver was one of America’s greatest country-folk singer-songwriters. With over 30 albums, he was more than a performer—he was an actor, environmentalist, and humanitarian. His music captured everyday life with deep conviction, especially in 'Take Me Home, Country Roads,' now one of West Virginia’s four state anthems. Bio: Robert Santelli was named Executive Director of the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles in 2006. Under his leadership, the Museum opened new locations, curated over 65 exhibits, produced 600+ public programs, and partnered with the White House and The Kennedy Center for education. A noted blues and rock historian, Santelli has contributed to Rolling Stone and The New York Times and authored over a dozen books, including the New York Times bestsellers Greetings From E Street and The Bob Dylan Scrapbook. He was an original curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and its first Director of Education and VP of Public Programs. In 2000, he became CEO of Seattle’s Experience Music Project (now MoPOP), the first interactive music museum. He also developed the UK’s first pop music museum, the British Music Experience. In 2012, Santelli co-produced Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection, earning a GRAMMY® nomination. After the GRAMMY Museum merged with the GRAMMY Foundation in 2017, he was named Founding Executive Director and now oversees its traveling exhibits and external projects.",country (style); folk artists; singers; environmentalists; music (performing arts genre); traveling exhibitions,Robert Santelli,David Pettyjohn,1:00:58,"Context, Idaho Humanities Council, https://idahohumanities.org/programs/connected-conversations/",video/mp4,Image;MovingImage,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Many saint-military marches, featuring hundreds in Napoleonic-era uniforms escorting a saint statue, received UNESCO recognition in 2012 as 'Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.' These processions often involve families with generations of participation. Binche is famous for its Carnival, featuring les Gilles—masked men with ostrich plume headdresses. In Mons and Ath, saint processions evolved into large-scale celebrations: Mons' festival includes mock combat with a dragon, while Ath’s features giant statues. The Carnival of Binche (2003), Le Doudou of Mons (2005), and La Ducasse of Ath (2005) all hold UNESCO recognition. These traditions, dating back to the late medieval period, ceased during the French Revolution but were revived in the 19th century. This talk explores their reinvention, 20th-century evolution, and their role in modern community identity.

Because of the relatively recent timing of the Fremont foraging-farming transition (AD 300-1300), we can learn a great deal about the subtle interplay between climatic conditions and social decisions leading to the intensification of farming, the formation of early agricultural villages, and the development of complex societies.

Ultimately, the project proved to be one of the largest projects in the state’s history recovering several hundred thousand artifacts.  There are multiple themes that came out of this project. In this talk Dr. Warner will talk about two of their findings: a broad question of Sandpoint’s early economic connections to the world and a local question that many don’t think about - namely the economics of prostitution in Sandpoint. Underlying this talk is a goal of sharing how archaeology of the recent past can contribute in unexpected ways to understanding (and sharing) the past.

The Stonewall Inn exists as a private establishment and working bar. Stonewall was a milestone for LGBTQ civil rights that provided momentum for a movement. In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid on the Stonewall Inn provoked a spontaneous act of resistance that earned a place alongside landmarks in American self-determination such as Seneca Falls Convention for women’s rights (1848) and the Selma to Montgomery March for African American voting rights (1965).

It will focus on Nazi use of traditional, conservative, populist and nostalgic themes to present a palatable program for non-Nazi members of the upper and middle classes that cut across traditional cultural cleavages in Germany, including religion, region, social class, gender, age, the rural-urban divide and the military-civilian divide.   Key issues include revision of the post-World War I treaty system, destruction of the perceived leftist threat to Germany, stabilization of the economy, and restoration of self-esteem and solid German values to social and cultural life.

Over time, solidarity between Native Hawaiians and Native Americans grew. Hawaiian activists supported the Standing Rock protests in 2016, opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline, while Native American activists backed the Mauna Kea protests in 2018-2019, even staging demonstrations on the mainland. These connections highlight a shared fight for indigenous rights.

Developing our news literacy can help us navigate the media landscape, and that means more than checking facts and spotting hoaxes. Yes, facts are important, but we also need a broader understanding of how news and information are produced and consumed in the digital age. What’s happening to real news, and how is it constructed? Are you in a filter bubble, and how can you break out? Are you the customer or the product in the attention economy, and how can citizens reclaim their power? Drawing on history, psychology, sociology, and politics, this conversation can help you increase your news literacy and teach others to do the same. Seth Ashley, PhD, is associate professor of journalism and media studies at Boise State University, where he also serves as faculty advisor for student media.

Innocent of any crime, many of them would remain imprisoned at Minidoka for over three years.

The turmoil produced some notable political characters, brought to an end the colorful and controversial career of perhaps the most liberal politician ever elected in Idaho, Democratic Senator Glen Hearst Taylor, and remarkably, particularly considering Idaho’s partisan make-up today, helped launched the unlikely political career of Senator Frank Church. Marc Johnson, a political historian and former chief of staff to Idaho’s longest serving governor, Cecil D.
