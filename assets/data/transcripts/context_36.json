Now collecting itself, dates back to the enlightenment, when Western powers were interested in going into other countries. and a lot of people would say looting, things like writings and statues and masks and, all sorts of cultural artifacts, that they could, bring back to Western countries, display, name, collect, and, and really, dictate the narrative around.",

Now, this is very important because, as these collection processes became standardized over the 19th and 20th century, we had to have a way to find things within the archives.",

And it also, then sort of creates a hierarchy in which things like stories, memories, oral history, a scarred kitchen table or a grandmother's quilt, those things lose value, because they don't have prestigious, custody chains.",

And again, this gets back to credibility, whose, stories were credible, who, was, seen to have a legitimate story. So, for instance, we can and look at the, letters of Jane Franklin, who was Benjamin Franklin's sister.

And space is incredibly important in, archival collections, because institutions only have so, so much space, so much money to create space, and really only so much, ability to make these spaces secure, have them at the correct temperatures, have them, stored in proper boxes, all of these things that, allow us to preserve documents that, you know, literally crumble because of, of their fragility.",

But corporate archives might not be interested in retaining documentation that makes them look bad, that demonstrates they may have polluted, or that they stripped, people of their rights in removing them from land. all sorts of, either a lack of preservation or poor preservation, tactics can be utilized to make sure that only positive stories are able to be told.",
