00;27;33;10 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, we do. I know one time. Oh, we've had our disagreements long and hard and, you know, if we'd ever get into a little argument or anything. One time we asked girls, how about you? And I said, no, ma'am, we wouldn't say we wouldn't take you to one of your parts because we love both of you.

00;27;56;27 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah. We've always got along real well. It's good. Real good to be. When I got married, I thought to myself, now you got to be my husband. My mother and my father, my brothers and my sisters, as we sure tried to seal the deal. well, because I didn't, you know, I've been away from them all the time.

00;28;17;16 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, my mom was always good to me and did what they could do. And if they didn't want to talk, then, I mean, it doesn't like it's your own people, you know?

00;28;28;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, did. Even though from what you say, it doesn't sound like they made you feel like you were didn't quite belong. You were an outsider. Did you kind of feel that way that I.

00;28;41;24 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: I sort of felt that way a little bit, but they didn't want me to feel that way. Not at all. It's just something that I couldn't accept, you know, because now they treat me just like they did their children. And that my aunt went out of her way to make her youngsters be nice to me. But you just can't accept something like that.

00;29;04;19 - Unknown Interviewer: And were you close to your mother?

00;29;07;12 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yes. Very close, of course. I was only eight to my daddy. Didn't you know if ever the any. We as kids get into an argument or spat or anything? Why, he'd give me a blister and he wouldn't bother. Yeah, there's so much, I guess, because that's all this battle.

00;29;25;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Of the affair. You know, this theory that has something to do with it. So did you have all of your children at home?

00;29;34;02 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yes. You're all born here from.

00;29;36;16 - Unknown Interviewer: Did you have a doctor?

00;29;38;08 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yes, I have a doctor about,

00;29;41;11 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. A very severe back acre woman.

00;29;45;05 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: My oldest daughter is. I was sick so long. The doctor had given me six, seven bottles of ether. Those two cans of ether, they were just about ready to cut her all the pieces and take her when finally she was born. I had real heart problems. All three of them.

00;30;08;22 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Sick for a long time. I got to get sick from the one girl from the next day or the next day before they got here.

00;30;22;05 - Unknown Interviewer: did you have any children? Did you want a retirement?

00;30;25;25 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh, I don't really know. When I was a girl, going to school always told the girls at school I should have seven for her, but that's what my mother had. So that's, I guess, maybe the reason I said it, I don't know, but I would have liked to have four and we would have liked to have had a boy, but we didn't get along so we wouldn't partner for a girl.

00;30;46;06 - Unknown Interviewer: So, why did you make a decision after you had the three? Did you want to have another one or no?

00;30;54;22 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: The doctor told me that was enough. And I said, as long as I live, you will have to have them, you know. So because I had.

00;31;04;28 - Unknown Interviewer: There was one that had.

00;31;07;09 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: That's what it was. It. And my youngest daughter had to have her baby's first through kind of running in the family, I guess, or something. Yeah.

00;31;20;04 - Unknown Interviewer: What do you do now for recreation.

00;31;23;09 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh, go to club, go to Grange and go to church. You.

00;31;29;12 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Mostly only have the. I have the three extension club and the community club. And then our Grange.

00;31;37;14 - Unknown Interviewer: You know what is the extension called?

00;31;40;21 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: It's, to teach people how to keep cows, though. They take a full spin, sewing and canning, all that kind of stuff.

00;31;54;15 - Unknown Interviewer: Just what are you do you teach people how to do things or do you learn how to do?

00;32;00;15 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, I just go mostly and listen anymore. I did when we first started out. Of course, it helped me to learn to do things belong to them. And since.

00;32;11;15 - Unknown: Older, I don't know, you know, so but.

00;32;17;00 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Anymore I just go to for the social part with the neighbors and things like.

00;32;22;07 - Unknown Interviewer: That. Did you teach your daughters to do a lot of things? Like.

00;32;26;03 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah, we did, yeah. The, when I got married, I had never, baked bread or clean chicken. And so I made sure that my daughters knew how to do all those things when they got married. and my husband, he knew how to do that. He was always good to help his mother. So he helped me learn a lot of that stuff.

00;32;51;07 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yes. He was very proud to tell you about cooking. I did miss First Lady tell the neighbors was it was just a joke, of course. But he would tell them that I made a cake 1 pound, and it was so hard that it sold out in the yard and the dog wouldn't even eat.

00;33;09;16 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Because he was real good to show me how to do things. The things that I didn't know how to do. You can learn a lot by doing for her.

00;33;19;26 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: And they also, they all crochet, near, I tried to give them everything that I figured I'd missed out on, and I think that's one reason that my mom is a teacher and one on the commercial, and another one is a housekeeper, because I wanted to be a teacher or a nurse. in a way, I got to be all three, I guess.

00;33;44;18 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: My youngest girl I know when she was little, she said one time, the oldest girl always said, well, I want to be a teacher. And the next girl didn't know what she wanted to do till she got through high school. But the youngest girl, when she was about three years old, one day somebody asked about, she says, I want to be a mama like mom and get a man like daddy.

00;34;08;26 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: so that's about what she had to.

00;34;13;19 - Unknown Interviewer: Did you want your children going to school?

00;34;15;28 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh, definitely. Yeah. I said, that's one thing they do. If there is any where you call it that possibility to get to school. Because I think an education helps people so much.

00;34;29;12 - Unknown Interviewer: Good. Began this daughter going to.

00;34;30;26 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: School because she had a year of college after she got to high school. And then when she went to Spokane, she took three months of college up there to learn to run computers and file her children is going to high school. She worked out and but she never really has like work out. She's a homemaker. Really? Right from the start.

00;34;55;02 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah. The second girl that's got to be an hour in life. She couldn't work. She couldn't make it at all. She's just one of these people that's got to be busy and and have a job, you know? And she works for three doctors down there who.

00;35;15;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Then we'll have the older who always worked. Where did they take come when they had their children?

00;35;24;20 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: I think Alice was off seven months from her job, but Alda took off. to see, I don't remember, several years old. And she's having to tell her children about two years apart. She has two boys and two girls. And then she waited till Debbie started school, and that's the youngest. And she went back.

00;35;49;25 - Unknown Interviewer: So what did you think about there? Working with children fairly well. I thought it.

00;35;56;22 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Was fun to pack it up and work for youngsters. I think set the law and I think I, I would like to do it myself and didn't get to. So I guess that's what I wanted to do it so bad. Well, how.

00;36;12;19 - Unknown Interviewer: Long when you were a midwife, where did you actually work and.

00;36;16;13 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Where? Where we just would go and take care of a baby when it was born, or if someone was sick, we'd go help out. Maybe their tour. We never knew. Just, you know, how long would last. But Mr. Slifer lived up here on the hill, and she was real good at that. And then when she got older, she wouldn't go unless somebody would go with her.

00;36;40;19 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: So. And my aunt did that. So I go with Mrs. Parker and for her. Mostly just be with her now. When aunt Grace, she had this first family and then ten years later, after they'd lost the little girl, then she had two more boys. And this older boy. Then when he was born, Uncle George was gone and we couldn't get the doctor.

00;37;07;13 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: And I was 16. That was,

00;37;12;17 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: He was born in August, before we was married the next day. And I was the only person person present besides my aunt. And she hadn't been able to tell me what to do and everything out of my heart for the heck the I got my period and got in early. Yeah. And then we we have, people. He stayed with us quite a lot different times.

00;37;39;11 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: It's just my I've got real bad ulcers on times. Couldn't take care of him very well. So I kept it for a year. And, then Joe or his brother, right, died when? Therefore, I was 14 when he came. And report goes for ten years. So we sort of had boys round to, you know.

00;38;07;27 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, how long's it been since you've actually done some work with midwife? Before?

00;38;17;23 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oxford. 15 years. And so I really didn't feel like the.

00;38;23;05 - Unknown Interviewer: One has most fit them. And the toward the end of your doing that was it just being with sick people or people, new babies or.

00;38;32;15 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah, just sick people. and then people with new babies, only with Doctor Christiansen several times a year. They'd always want somebody to come with him and the doctors at to come out, you know, and different people were born in all of down here. I was the third one. Three of our children were born, and I that's a gross cause.

00;38;55;18 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: In fact, one of Ethel's children were born right in my house. And she stayed with me for, you know, took care of her. Well, she and you always get used to. You had to stay in bed for ten days after the baby was born. Now, I guess the third day in the hospital and that I'm up to get him and walk in and everything.

00;39;14;06 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: But back in those days, you didn't do that? Yeah. They thought it was another day off. Or if you got out of bed before ten days. I know my dad came down from Canada and my second girl was born analysis for. And she was born at six in the morning. And we got here at 630. And well, the next day I got up and went to the table to eat dinner with him because I hadn't seen you for a long time, and my aunt just thought that was off my what the worst thing I could do get out of bed.

00;39;48;21 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: But it didn't seem to hurt me. I went back to bed.

00;39;56;13 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: But I hadn't seen him for several years or. Excited? No, no.

00;40;05;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, did you keep getting back up while he was here?

00;40;08;22 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: No, I was back this and stayed my ten days.

00;40;15;06 - Unknown Interviewer: The magic number?

00;40;16;11 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah.

00;40;20;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, did you get paid to do this?

00;40;23;21 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: No. It was all just to know. We didn't expect him to pay back in those days for things like that. You helped your neighbor out and you didn't. If you ever needed help, they'd come help you. That's the way it would. Well, we didn't expect to pay.

00;40;45;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, was it more of kind of training services or was it just whenever there was a need?

00;40;51;25 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Just wasn't there was a need to. Well, we didn't consider being traded. Do you know somebody needed your help when you went and how Tillman was to.

00;41;04;17 - Unknown Interviewer: When did you first get insurance of any kind?

00;41;11;02 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh let's see, I think it was when, Agnes, that's the youngest one, was three years old, and, without some life insurance. His folks, of course, they, when they first came into the country, weren't very well to do, but they were considered pretty well-to-do at the time. We was married to senior or have these older ones, and he's next to the baby, and they never believed in any kind of experience or anything.

00;41;43;08 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: So I had quite a time talking my husband into taking out insurance, but I told him that something was to happen to him. I didn't know how in the world I could even bury him, you know, because.

00;41;58;29 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: We didn't have any insurance and just the place was an awful hardship. So he family to go the insurance and life insurance and eventually we have we had all these other insurance.

00;42;14;25 - Unknown Interviewer: That's just what it seems like, for a while that your rural insurance was helping your neighbors. and then when you needed it, they were there. That's right.

00;42;28;21 - Unknown: What have you done to help support your family?

00;42;35;01 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Just any way I could have went out in the field and worked. And of course, we have our garden. And Kim helped do chores, milk cows and just anything there was to do on the place that that I could do. That's the only way that I've ever felt and never had any money to put towards it.

00;42;59;12 - Unknown Interviewer: I haven't seen the question. The your.

00;43;03;20 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, that's about the time the shortly after we was married, you know, that it started and that was really hard and it really tough. We had to live through that of course in the mid two to, well, World War two and then the Korean War and everything was pretty rough. Go on for a while.

00;43;28;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Did it affect your a lot or just make it harder than it usually had?

00;43;36;20 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah. Just harder. It, it didn't really affect us so much, but, of course we had back in those days, they have these, ration stamps. You know, you couldn't get only just so much sugar or so much gas or so many calories from US Army, but they dish you out to you could get it pretty rough to get back, but we made it.

00;44;03;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Were there any people in this community that were really hard hit by the depression?

00;44;10;13 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah, that was Pillsbury family. That really.

00;44;13;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Was true. Did they have farm?

00;44;17;00 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah, they were on farms. But, I don't know what was the reason that I know there was one family that. Well, there was 2 or 3 families here that had really hard row. part of it was sickness. I think one family. I know the man was sick. He just couldn't work for a good, real hard. Do.

00;44;45;09 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: But we always saying that those people had something deep or not close to keep warm after everybody else would chip in and out.

00;44;55;27 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: And when we take our flour to take our wheat to the flour mill, the ground for the different ones taking potatoes and flour and stuff like that. So just give it to.

00;45;09;21 - Unknown Interviewer: The the depression or the war, like most.

00;45;15;07 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh, I'd say about the same.

00;45;19;17 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: I, World War two, of course. It took some of our relatives in the service. You know, we all came back. Some of them were my cousin that I lived with and one that I brought into the world by myself, has been handicapped. He got shot through the right shoulder. the. Of course, those things are sad and all, but you just have to live through and take them, you know, there's nothing you can.

00;45;52;27 - Unknown: Do that route.

00;45;58;17 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: One thing I might mention, years and years ago, when we was first married, if somebody died, you know, they never took them to the undertaker. Father. They was always taken care of at home and someone would have to set up with them. And I know one night, the two schoolteachers, I was in the eighth grade and Grandma Herring down here passed away.

00;46;21;11 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, my aunt was a person that, she was a real good Christian woman and everything. And she believed in people facing up to the hardships and the things. You know, that's one thing that she always taught us. And she made me go with these two teachers and set up with that lady that night. And you'd have to wring rags out of formaldehyde solution and put on them, you know, to keep from getting so dark turned purple, all in that, place where we.

00;46;52;26 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: She was just lived in a two bedroom shack and we opened the door for the window in the room where she was put away, and the cats got in there that my neighbor always told us that cats would eat on dead people. That was kind of spooky that my whole experience that I had, that kind of bothered me.

00;47;13;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, this is just what they were getting ready for.

00;47;15;07 - Unknown: The funeral today. This preserved the man who threw.

00;47;22;25 - Unknown: You know.

00;47;23;27 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: This late model club table or a board, you know, so that they could be in the right shape. You know, they didn't need to embalm them like they do now.

00;47;38;10 - Unknown Interviewer: When you think better funeral practices now, I've compared to them.

00;47;43;04 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh, they're a lot better now of course. But my they're high priced. You ever you hear the remark a lot of times that you can't afford to live, that you can't afford to die there.

00;47;54;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah.

00;47;54;27 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: That's but it's no comparison. Now look what it was then. That was. And then there was some people that was really hard to take, you know, to do, to be able to take care of somebody that is.

00;48;10;04 - Unknown: Passed away, you know. Yeah, I can imagine it isn't.

00;48;15;03 - Unknown Interviewer: The most pleasant experience. No. What church isn't, what type of church you go to?

00;48;23;01 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Who I go to, you do church, the main Mount United Brethren, the name of that, I guess. And then I had belonged to the Methodist Church for several years when we used in Clarkston, we went with the Salvation Army, and I enjoyed that. I really liked the that they had the musical instruments and, Well, I don't know, they were more jolly and happy.

00;48;53;14 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: The churches that I've come to before that they always seem like you always had to be so sad, to be so quiet and solemn and everything. You know, I went and went to the Salvation Army, where, of course, they're happy. Damn. And, now over here at, at United Brethren, they're home. Or they have their musical instruments and clap their hands.

00;49;19;02 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: And it's a lot different than it was when I first started to explore.

00;49;24;22 - Unknown Interviewer: We like it better this way.

00;49;27;17 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yes. it's all right for those. But I can't get emotional because I was when I was young. I think things that put into your mind and things when you're young, it's hard to get over it, you know? And I can't join in with them and stomp my feet and clap my hands, but I don't I don't mind them doing that.

00;49;47;19 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: I think that's okay. But I was always taught that you're supposed to go to church and be quiet and set up the Excel.

00;49;55;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, the Salvation Army essentially does that, right, but they were just happier about and.

00;50;05;08 - Unknown Interviewer: as far as church preferences, it just more or less by what it's been here.

00;50;09;13 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah. That's what we've had to go to. If I had my preference. I belong to the Baptist church. When we was down lost and we went to that some. And then there used to be a Sunday school Johnson we called him that came around and organized some the schools out in these rural communities. And, we'd go to Lewiston.

00;50;34;08 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: And he always held his meetings in the Baptist church down there, Lewiston, Clarkston. And we'd take those in. And then he had Bible camp, and he started in that way, and we liked him real well. And I just like a church. But I've never lived where we could belong to that camp. The when we first came here, this was called the Dunker Church.

00;50;59;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Dunkirk.

00;51;00;02 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: The Dunkirk church and the, were real long dresses who had long sleeves and, and then they had this little prayer veil that they wore a woman. And their belief is that the woman couldn't in the church muster had discovered, so women, they had to put off and they have, in the church down here, there's a place under a platform where they put in the water, and the people baptized in the church and might have their little feast and the supper and everything.

00;51;36;04 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: It's, a lot different than how it is nowadays. Of course, the people have all moved away, and, we've got to be a, union Sunday school, you know, for some school jobs and around it. And then we finally made it into a community church.

00;51;54;02 - Unknown Interviewer: And you're sort of like.

00;51;55;00 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: You've been my.

00;51;55;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Neck.

00;51;58;24 - Unknown: You're still there. Yeah, that's. That's true. Strange.

00;52;04;00 - Unknown Interviewer: Then what type of church pray.

00;52;07;01 - Unknown Interviewer: You enjoy the most? You know, as far as traditional ritual?

00;52;14;27 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: I just like Plano Church. The Bible preached.

00;52;20;16 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, I can say.

00;52;23;22 - Unknown Interviewer: When you think about things like the preparation.

00;52;27;20 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Oh, I never did think that was necessary. I like to have, to have communion, you know, and then once we're here, pretty much they have, I don't know just how often, but I've been there several times, and that's fine. I think that I never went so far. I just think you have to, although it's in the Bible, bottom portion on those the and the doctors, they believe that.

00;52;56;06 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: And I wouldn't stand for any Sharkey or either. you have to have long hair. That is the women did you know?

00;53;08;25 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: So I never really went along with all that, but. And then they their dress was so different and everything. Think that. Unfortunate. But.

00;53;26;11 - Unknown Interviewer: What? magazines and newspapers.

00;54;17;20 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: quite a bit. father used to when we first got TV, the youngsters looked at it. But, now that I. Have more time. And everything else you ask for was quite a few of the soap operas during the day.

00;54;35;18 - Unknown Interviewer: Which shows do you like the best?

00;54;38;18 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, right now, my favorite one is, All My Children. And we used to work. I was the guiding light and, search for tomorrow and at night, Bob, my name won't appear.

00;54;56;03 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you think those are strange? The way the people go hungry?

00;55;02;18 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Well, I think they're a little far out sometimes. I don't know, maybe the that all that that's on those programs happened. People's lives. But sometimes I wonder if the first of all, it all did happen.

01;05;49;21 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: I don't think so. That places high prices for the land and everything. We wonder whether they, make it or not. but I don't think there's anything that any of us could do about it.

01;06;24;07 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: So he's just keep it.

01;06;28;00 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Back. It was 3000. I think it was the price of land then for the 60. Then we bought another place, 40 acres down here for $2,000 and. And another 40 for 5000. And then later you. Yeah, but now it's worth a hundred and something thousand dollars.

01;06;49;18 - Unknown Interviewer: Lost the house.

01;06;50;12 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: Yeah. So it's really changed a lot.

01;06;56;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Was it very hard to get into farming? Real started there?

01;07;03;16 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: no, I wouldn't say that. It was so hard then because you farmed resources. when we bought the place bar, we have three horses, and then we had 14 before the, But it's so hard to get started then, because the machinery and things, you know, wasn't near the hard size that it is nowadays.

01;07;27;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Of the year. Or have you officially farmed it by yourself?

01;07;32;17 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: We farmed it ourselves until I was 67, and then he rented it out. So we, and we had a real good renter. And Cassie has taken care of it since till this year. He's old enough, he's retiring, and now we have run the trigger for for children, boys who are.

01;07;54;22 - Unknown Interviewer: Renting it some from all over.

01;08;29;11 - Unknown: You know, if if they don't farm.

01;08;34;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Would you like to see them get involved in farming?

01;08;39;01 - Pearl Gaynor Choate: If they could care enough that they could make a good living out of. I think it would be nice. And I think they all would like to do it, but it just doesn't work out. So I think, you know, if it start.
