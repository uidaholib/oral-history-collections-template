That was known to be a hangout for LGBTQ people. You could be arrested for any de facto, crimes. Just for. It's almost like disturbing the peace. And so when you think of Stonewall National Monument, if you've actually been here, a lot of people think it's just Christopher Park, in the village, but it is actually the footprint of the park, the footprint of the Stonewall Inn and 7.7 acres of the streets and sidewalks where the riots actually spilled out.",

So there was no out there was just in we're going to go through a couple of different things about how it was to be LGBTQ. Before Stonewall. A lot of people were really scared about the outcomes of being LGBTQ because not only were you discriminated against, and it was illegal, basically, as I said, to be any part of the gay culture.",

They decide that they are going to to, protest the liquor license, in New York, which bars could only receive a liquor license if they agreed not to openly serve homosexuals? So, the marching society said they were going to protest this, and so they decided to get a photographer on board, and they're going to go from bar to bar to bar in New York City openly declaring that they are homosexuals and, and then trying to order drinks.",

So then they just go to the next bar. So they get to Julius's. And as you see in the photograph, they were denied the drinks.

Really just awful things. You. Yeah, I'm sure, you know, if you're of the age that you were around before Stonewall, you know, people of those community were just not treated very well, by the police, by their peers, by their employers, about just everyone.",

So really quickly, we're going to go through some of so the, the times in the 60s were changing, but it didn't seem like it was going fast enough.

    "description": "Stonewall National Monument is a new national park unit located in Christopher Park, part of New York City's Historic Greenwich Village . It is a park in progress with limited services, and in the coming years services will be added to the park in cooperation with our partners. The monument sits across the street from The Stonewall Inn, a National Historic Landmark known for its involvement in the beginning of the modern struggle for civil rights of gay and lesbian Americans. The Stonewall Inn exists as a private establishment and working bar. Stonewall was a milestone for LGBTQ civil rights that provided momentum for a movement. In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid on the Stonewall Inn provoked a spontaneous act of resistance that earned a place alongside landmarks in American self-determination such as Seneca Falls Convention for women’s rights (1848) and the Selma to Montgomery March for African American voting rights (1965). Demonstrations continued over the next several nights at Christopher Park across from the Stonewall Inn and in the surrounding neighborhood. When asked to describe the difference that Stonewall had made, journalist Eric Marcus observed that before Stonewall, “For most people, there was no out, there was just in.”",
