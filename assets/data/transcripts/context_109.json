So the things that a city can't really do anything about, but typically are the things that drove its its birth. Things like rivers, lakes, mountains, ports, forests, minerals, etc.. The second, though, is what a city and its leaders, both elected leaders as well as citizen activists do with those surroundings and what they make of them.",

We're going to talk about that transition, the transition of our identity from industrial city, which a lot of you probably don't know much about to what I'm going to call today's Green City and why the leaders are elected leaders in particular, might not have wanted Boise to be a lunch bucket town with blue collar workers and instead thought sort of this white",

Closer to home in the valley itself, government surveyors were, busy surveying the land to determine, what basically to take inventory of and to determine where people could, homestead and create farms and, in the process of doing that, they also noted that the Boise foothills were extremely valuable for grazing, and that brought,",
