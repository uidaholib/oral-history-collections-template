00:55:16:27 - Patricia McDaniel: How do they feel about.

00:55:18:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh, they feel they feel, towards me. I thought time when they were a little racist. Then they say you got a lot of power with your forgiveness. You know that the power is, is, it's everybody, everybody that help, including the bishop, all the fathers, all the men, everybody. There's I just made. I made the head man, you know, and because the news media was there for me all the time, you know, and times, my, my face was on the picture, on the paper and, and little things that I say and all that.

00:56:08:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And then they used to approach me about, how did I feel about the Mexican children that, they're so, so, lack of, schooling, you know, and things like. And then I give my, my $0.02 into that, and no one was taking place at some time about, the Mexican people come over here from Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and it California to work and why?

00:56:45:15 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: In the same time, they ask me why the Mexican people feel so uneducated. I say, well, what you see here is what you, you see on any in any town, on any big town, even United States in the skirt. And you see the poverty.

00:57:08:09 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: In any place in Texas, they, they have more white collar workers. The only thing I did coming over here or lawyers or doctors, then nothing but a poor people, they cannot even find jobs over there. For they had they come here looking for a job and that's all you see, you know, and this is my fight. We have to educate these children equally with their wisdom.

00:57:33:13 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They have the chance to go to school and and the the people, the teachers and and the, state officials and all that. They start to listen, you know, listen, we got a real, real pretty fair, you know, and, that we will more and more and more. My boy, my boy was,

01:02:35:23 - Patricia McDaniel: It's a good year and a house.

01:02:36:23 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes, yes. And so, It's one of those.

01:02:49:29 - Patricia McDaniel: This is Patricia McDaniel. Today is November 15th, 1991. I will be interviewing for the second time. so I knew it was the biggest of Nampa, Idaho.

01:03:05:19 - Patricia McDaniel: This is Antonio Rodriguez. Our second conversation today is November 15th, 1991. We will attempt to have this part of the interview in English. All right, Mr. Rodriguez, the other day we had a conversation all about you are living in Idaho and becoming very active in the civil rights movement here today. We're going to concentrate a little bit on, questions of your of your, Hispanic history, your Hispanic heritage and also culture and living in the community.

01:03:38:06 - Patricia McDaniel: begin by asking, first of all, how do you define yourself? Are you do you define yourself as a Mexican, as a Mexican, American, as a Latino? How do you define yourself?

01:03:49:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I always find myself, Mexican American, Mexican descent. Always. All the time. And, I don't go for, for, Any other. Just Mexican American.

01:04:12:06 - Patricia McDaniel: Is this the same way that your parents identify themselves?

01:04:15:16 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Exactly.

01:04:16:09 - Patricia McDaniel: They they identify themselves as Mexican Americans. And your children. How do they identify the same thing? The same thing? Same.

01:04:28:25 - Patricia McDaniel: has this identification or this label, this identity that you have influenced you in how you have lived in this country or context of influence?

01:04:41:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: you mean to become to think about Mexican Americans?

01:04:46:29 - Patricia McDaniel: Yeah. To be in. Oh, well, in this country.

01:04:50:03 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: One where it begins was way, way back. Way back from, 19, 1927 that, there was so much, so much discrimination against Mexican people in Texas that, my daddy, all Mexican people cannot belong into, any city, like, city council or becoming, police deputy or nothing long. You're a Mexican. Yeah.

01:05:24:18 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: So I was pretty, pretty young that I, even my myself because of Mexican, you know, because Mexican. And can't do that in Mexican. Can't do this in Mexican. Can have this and all that. So I considered, okay, in, in our thinking, in our mind that, okay, we're Mexicans and what about, you know, so that's one of they grow.

01:05:52:19 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I said, well, if I am a Mexican, I am a Mexican American citizen, Mexican descent. That's what I want. And that's where it was. Where the beginning of it. Okay. There is no other way for me to say that I am, Latino. And if we call Mexico Latin America, I am a Latino, you know, but, like today, you know, here regionally, they start with this Hispanic, Hispanic, you know.

01:06:33:22 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, I am Hispanic. History, I guess, and and very proud of it because, you know, I think we, all these little nations that I for, I mean, here and here, you know, like, Argentina and, Brazil and all the South America and they all Spanish speaking. I think we can, outnumber United States of America.

01:07:04:25 - Patricia McDaniel: By many.

01:07:06:04 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And all Spanish speaking. Yeah. You know, so and that put us, right now and a pretty high category that we got a language we belong from, from, Hispanic descent. And we're very proud because we count in this world just like anybody. Oh, excuse.

01:07:32:09 - Patricia McDaniel: Me, please tell me about when you said that. When you were young and living in Texas, you weren't able to. Or Mexican Americans were not able to participate in the civic government of the community. They couldn't hold office. They couldn't be part of the police force. Tell me a little bit about how those limitations influenced you.

01:07:53:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, starting with the school. See, we, the Mexican people, they have their own school, grammar school. And the white people have their own. The Negros has their own. So they all separate. And, and that's where they start that that, when I start learning about life, you know, I keep myself as an individual. I keep thinking, why is this?

01:08:27:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You know, this when I was around eight, eight years, nine years, you know, before that we didn't put no tension about a little white kid. They used to come and play in our yard, and we played with him like we were brothers, you know? And, and sometime the, this, white people come home and all that seem like they don't like for the key to to get mixed up with us.

01:08:59:23 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And they took him away. And when he could not, the engine and so, so we grow up in, We, we start learning more and more about a little bit about that. We have rights but the, the, the law and that little official and that city when we were born, we can't see the Texas they had the law and the, officers, they, they, they, they get, all these jobs, you know, they got some work control in and within the city, within the county that, Mexican person cannot, drive a tractor when it is on the city for the city or do anything or if you wants to go, a boy wants to

01:09:59:04 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: go to be electrician. They do something to stop that kid. That's the way. What? You know, they don't want. No, no, no, Mexican descent people. affiliate jobs where the whites was always taken. They don't want, in other words, let me say this. I went to I went to look for a job. I was 14 years old in a restaurant, and, it was during the depression.

01:10:36:28 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And sometimes they pay us $0.50 a day, and, this, this man, he says I ask for a government of, Yeah, government. We used to go buy Gomez, you know, over there, you know, and, yeah, I, I, you know, the Gomez good workers and all the rest are all I said, well, I give you $0.15 a day, you know.

01:11:03:20 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: $0.15 a day to wash dishes and the rest. And then, well, I said, let me go see my father, you know, and I went and told my father, and I said, no, they don't give you $0.50 a day at least not don't work. And I went told him I went back and told him. He said, well, Mexican people, he says they don't need their ma, they don't need they don't eat very much.

01:11:26:23 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They don't need no money, just little bit, you know, just keep him alive. I remember that, and that will clear down to my heart. And I started creating grudge against whites. Yeah. Really? Really. And so, we went we continue school into a new school until we learn more about. Right. Hey, nobody, according to one of the, the Constitution of America.

01:12:02:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You know, we we've got an equal rights.

01:12:05:01 - Patricia McDaniel: And you learn that in school.

01:12:06:16 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: In school.

01:12:07:08 - Patricia McDaniel: You in school. And it was all Mexican children in school. You were learning about the American Constitution.

01:12:13:05 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, and, you know, the the the teacher had, limitations to, you know, to teachers. And they didn't teachers. exactly. Or, evaluate our, our work in school as it should be if you, if I, if I fail on on a little something, you know, they, they, they put the, they fix they fix my papers if, if I done it right, because they want me to to go.

01:12:49:12 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They want to show someplace that this boys, they really learning well when they get up there and, and on the eighth grade. Well, what did I have? Nothing. Nothing. And I won't have nothing to go high school. Right.

01:13:06:18 - Patricia McDaniel: When you say you had nothing at the eighth grade, does that mean that you didn't have some of the you didn't have the abilities?

01:13:13:19 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I didn't have the abilities because I didn't learn it. Right. You know.

01:13:58:15 - Patricia McDaniel: You were talking the other day that you came to Idaho because somebody here told you that the life here was better.

01:14:04:17 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes. Well, the people who invite us over here to to come and work in there. And the beets, the one he told me is, Tony, you can make over there $5 a day, not $0.50 or a dollar a day, because it's a guaranteed job, you know, for certain period of time in the summer, all kinds of new jobs and everything that that's the reason.

01:14:30:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And this is and they treat you better over there, treat you like a human.

01:14:34:19 - Patricia McDaniel: And when you you said the other day that when you came to Idaho, they did treat you. They did did very.

01:14:39:18 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Very, very.

01:14:40:13 - Patricia McDaniel: You still find discrimination here. You talked about it a little bit.

01:14:43:20 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, the only discrimination, that I found was that, you know, like I told you the other day on the 60s, I went about these signs and, and, beer, beer joints in and barbershops and things like that, you know, and then they put this sign, all this kind of no Mexicano Negro, no Jews. No, no Indians, no dogs.

01:15:10:24 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You you know, that's when we got mad. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's a kind of discrimination. But, a lot of, oh, my people used to call discrimination when they couldn't get, a job that they want. You know, it is today. If a man go and ask for a job at the police department and he don't have the schooling and the knowledge, you know, to even to fill up that that, application, well, he won't have no business there.

01:15:49:24 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And some, they used to cry discrimination. And this is why I went to, to, become, pretty close, member of the within the police department there for quite a few years to learn what was going on, and there was no discrimination there. It was it that they didn't have the schooling, you know, how can a six gray man go and get an application and fill it up and and and and then become a police officer?

01:16:22:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You know, so I start I start going back. And I was one of the man I, I stayed in the police department until I become the chairman of the committee, you know, the Civil Service Commission within the police department and, city council. Well, the city council will have to approve me, you know, when I first start and all that.

01:16:47:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, and then, I mean, we we put, applications all over, and I had some times in front of my desk, the 3 or 4, Mexican descent people. But when you get to the schooling, you just don't reach, see? And then because I was there and they called me or they called me here in room of their business, is it only how come I didn't make it?

01:17:21:08 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And then I explained, they believe me, but they didn't believe quite right.

01:17:26:24 - Patricia McDaniel: They were willing to what you call my background education. But would it be possible that somebody would not be able to, qualify because of his education, because he didn't have the opportunity to be educated like you?

01:17:41:05 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes.

01:17:41:19 - Patricia McDaniel: Well, have the opportunity to be educated.

01:17:44:28 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And some of the people, they they had an opportunity, but, but the job that they have to they they're the only no to do, they have to go from a state to state or, or there were no jobs. It's what they, you know, they have to work and go to school at those times. And it was impossible to have it right on their home, on the one place alone, you know, so they can go to school and work.

01:18:18:27 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: That was very hard for many, many, many. Like I said the other day, everybody that comes here to Idaho, we have they're starting since 1935. We over here, you know, nobody come here to Idaho as a lawyer or doctor or, you know, well, engineer or whatnot. Only uneducated people can work. And people and including myself, you know, and that's what you'll find in Idaho and Idaho has been, has been, a real, what they call, sparkling star for us because, regardless of the of the struggles and, and, arguments and veils and this and that, you know, I can see and Mexican people, fruity, good and high progress and

01:19:18:29 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: and the school and children learning.

01:19:22:01 - Patricia McDaniel: So speak and Americans are putting a value education. Yeah. So their children and do you do you feel that they real that they believe that it is with education that their children will be able to.

01:19:37:17 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Progress in advance? Oh, yeah. and, and you know, you know, I had, an article on a paper way up there, 1960 that all I see is the schooling for my children, my my people. That's why I used to put it. I want more opportunity for them. Let's find, way to educate those. Stay from the state.

01:20:11:01 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Go working folks to see if we can reach them a little more. You know, and that's when they start. And then 1964, when, when the civil rights become about, that's when they started, with over here, all the children, they come to the camps and the folks come up to work, there was a place for them to, to go to school or they have one in the back on, in a camp or something.

01:20:44:04 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And they were they all weren't going to school, you know, like first grade or second rate kids. They continue. They're not just losing their time for nothing. And that's why that is same thing. You can see at that time there was nobody, nobody Mexican girls and men, it's the secretaries all over like it is now, right everywhere now.

01:21:15:11 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And this is my dream. When I go and visit those stores and I see those young girls and all that, and. And I, I walk out of those places real happy for them. They don't know that I've done that. They don't know me. But I go around. So that's a good feeling.

01:21:39:16 - Patricia McDaniel: Let's talk a little bit about the custom that Mexican Americans have in you and particularly with your family and of the customs that your family handed down and that you still have, what customs that you had. what what questions were handed down to you by your family?

01:22:01:28 - Unknown: Well, like, we take religion, with the,

01:22:07:04 - Patricia McDaniel: Traditions and holidays and.

01:22:10:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh, we have. Well, we always, since I was a little boy, my father say, I was, I lost my mama when I was five. And my father, he keep taking us to the Catholic Church over in Port City every Sunday. It was five miles away.

01:22:29:22 - Patricia McDaniel: Was the Mexican.

01:22:31:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: American with here and. No, there was a there was desegregated there, too. We go to the same church. The whites have to be on the right side and and the Mexican people on the left side. You cannot say for the whites what it was.

01:22:47:23 - Patricia McDaniel: With a priest was English speaking.

01:22:50:08 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes. And they have they have, once in a while they had, a Mexican priest there, like, maybe help or the other father going to retreat or something, but he came and gave them mass and all that, you know, and, this Mexican father, he used to come for us. We never just say nothing to the white people.

01:23:17:02 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: But he says, look, he says, they they won the right side. He says the white people don't know what is their rights. Right? And we ask the father why. He says, look, they face in me on my left.

01:23:38:11 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: so, we just take it for fun and we laugh a little bit, you know, they say. But he used to tell us, don't use no grudge. Don't condemn their life to their doings. Love them. You know, that's what on the livestream, and that's. I mean, he's in the restroom. No, no, no, we, no.

01:24:06:13 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Three. Now, this is where you learn the the, catechism. The catechism and all that. Yeah, all Mexican people, boys and girls. And then he used to, that's when the father, Mexican father used to come over and he said, you're doing the job that God wants you to do. They want to do it different. Let him do it, but don't hate them.

01:24:31:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Don't this and do. That's when I started. I was already about 15. That's what I start saying. Well, who am I to hate who, you know, and I didn't, we we got break up on that, you know, so we, we love we love white. We love black. We love anybody, you know, because we they explain to us there is you are nobody with the will of God.

01:24:58:13 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You can got no business here. So you here and got business because of him. And you know that way he he was real good.

01:25:07:01 - Patricia McDaniel: So that Catholic tradition was very strong.

01:25:09:28 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes it still is. Still isn't that great. I went last year, I went to family Reunion and it was a big wedding in my cut. One of my cousins who still is. Yeah. Very strong. We love it.

01:25:26:17 - Patricia McDaniel: And your children are and your children have stayed in the church.

01:25:29:28 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh yes. All of the traditions in the past. Yes.

01:25:33:05 - Patricia McDaniel: All of them are there, are there Mexican American customs in, in your Catholicism that you recognize that aren't done in the white Catholic Church now, which are there holidays or cuts or. it's definitely sad. And holidays like, will be a commercial, the adoption that they can see that the reason they.

01:25:59:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Guadalupe correctly.

01:26:01:08 - Patricia McDaniel: Recognized that. Yeah. I know that in the, Anglo or the white Catholic Church.

01:26:06:19 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They don't move. Right.

01:26:08:05 - Patricia McDaniel: But are those kinds of.

01:26:09:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh, yes. Every year, every year we have a big doing here in the Church of Saint Paul. We, sometimes we get out 5:00 in the morning and one bunch up over there with a lot of flowers and phone, and we send a plasma in Anita's. You new to her? You know, in his sound. And sometimes when I, I used to have, mariachis over here, we take the mariachi to the church, and at 5:00 in the morning with that beautiful song, I mean, music, you know, can bundle underneath that and wait.

01:26:47:25 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: February. Very happy.

01:26:50:06 - Patricia McDaniel: Yeah. Know what are holidays that are celebrated by the by, you know, Mexican Americans that aren't celebrated? Well,

01:26:59:17 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: We we celebrate the Cinco de Mayo, and then, I'll just say this at the embassy. You know, Bellavia, it goes from very, very strong.

01:27:09:25 - Patricia McDaniel: And that's a and that's a holiday here in Napa for that and call.

01:27:13:15 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, well, car. Well, and, this is it says at the embassy is not been, made here in Nampa. My boy has been in charge of that and have been make in Boise because of the college. Yeah. You know, and.

01:27:28:16 - Patricia McDaniel: That's also the Fiesta. That's tomorrow.

01:27:31:15 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yeah. In Boise. That's why, that's why. And, they have mariachis. I don't know if you want this. Last year now I was in I had to go.

01:27:40:25 - Patricia McDaniel: To a conference in Florida that weekend.

01:27:43:18 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I think I.

01:27:44:14 - Patricia McDaniel: Didn't get. But last year I went.

01:27:46:14 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh okay. Well see they, they it was so beautiful that they even the, the, one of the main guys from Seattle, he came over because of the image, organization and he, he makes speech, beautiful speech, you know, and he says it. This is the first time that he ever seen so many Hispanic people acting better, than us.

01:28:19:12 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: He says. And we will listen, you know, we we we are very, very interested to listen what everybody's saying, you know, without a turn in the face and start talking with somebody else. And, and that man just, smoke in his head, you know, and nobody listen. We always listen. And and it was packed. It was packed.

01:28:46:18 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: It was Rudy Pena. He made a speech there, too, and and so on. But there was real, real beautiful.

01:28:55:03 - Patricia McDaniel: so you you feel that the cultural identity of the, of the Mexican American is very strong and recognized in his holidays.

01:29:05:11 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yeah. Yes, yes. very. We got a, we got, very good. young leaders coming up. You know, they're getting they got. Well-educated and, and they coming out with with a good, good, work. You know, on that line like, schooling and tradition, culture and things like that. And, you know.

01:29:41:18 - Patricia McDaniel: How did you pass on to your own children their sense of identity and their culture?

01:29:50:14 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Live in it together with me. And I was pretty close to them. See, I was right here when they were growing right here. And Marvin and and, had the restaurant the same time, but what I did was that we was close in two days a week at that time, the business. And every moment, every second that I can, I pass.

01:30:19:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: It was my children, you know, and I always in the evening we sit down around when I take him out to McCall, Idaho City, you know, and mostly we stay overnight and we put fire. And I always was after them on, on our way of life, marry my wife. And it was so poor. We were so poor that I didn't put no shoes in my feet until I was 16 years old.

01:30:54:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I go to kill a rattlesnake with my bottom of my feet. Did that.

01:30:59:24 - Patricia McDaniel: Because they said that.

01:31:01:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Dog.

01:31:02:10 - Patricia McDaniel: Is.

01:31:04:05 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well. And then here I was with my family, my three, my three children and my wife, and around the fire. And then. Because of, the, I heard. Oh, here and there, you know, that, there was, there was a discrimination in certain certain places and all that. I keep saying to my children that nobody have no right to discriminate, nobody but the children and I used to say all things like that when I, when I was young, I told them how I was growing up, up.

01:31:53:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And we always put those things aside and behind us. And you, you have more opportunity today. All three of you, that to go to school and learn your, your rights and fight for your rights with in the law. Don't take the law in your hands within the law. And then, I keep on and on, you know, come down.

01:32:36:04 - Patricia McDaniel: The creek. Okay.

01:32:45:15 - Patricia McDaniel: All right. Go ahead.

01:32:46:24 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, I used to to tell them about, makes a little bit about Jesus. I bring it a few times, but a few times to them. I said, remember, we was born and raised in Quincy, Texas. Mary was born in Hebbronville, Texas, north where we are about 2000 miles away from where we were born. Why? To better ourselves on the job.

01:33:14:00 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And this is it. And this is not wrong at all, because Jesus. The mother and and, and, Joseph heard this angel tell him to go to Angel to save the children's lives.

01:33:32:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, if you can feed them. That went someplace in the state for a long time over there. The whole we the. We can't come here and stay for a while forever. He gave us that. For example, I said yes, Jesus. And, And I put it to them the best way I could, for them to, to rely in and God and Jesus when they need help, you know, just asking.

01:34:09:24 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: He'll give you give it to you by asking. And they went on and they and they got so many questions for me, especially the older girl. She was almost seven years older than the other two. And, I answer the best way I can, always, for the good of of, of their future life. You know, I never did.

01:34:44:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I never did bring anything to them about grudge or mad or anything. You know, about nothing. My my children. of course, right now they are the oldest. She's going to be 50 here. Buddhism and junior is 41 for and going to be 42. And Mitch is 39. And, that they can say that I never I always hide myself.

01:35:20:06 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: If I going to say a word like, cuss word like, oh, goddamn it or something like that, I never I try not to be in front of them ever. You know? I don't want them to know me that way. You know that I, I, I will look at them. They come in, you know, I respect them because I feel in my own heart that if I don't respect that child, that child won't have no respect to me.

01:35:49:19 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: you know, and and I cannot given advice, and hold, you know, so I use my head pretty much. And embracing my children because my daddy was, was one of them to him. And he was pretty, pretty strict with us, by getting, ourselves in trouble and all that, he was pretty close to us, you know what I mean?

01:36:14:21 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: He always sit down with us, and he says, look, Antonio or Santos, this, this, this. Did, you know, things did to happen on his on his young life. He bring it up to us. Whatever happened, you know, by doing wrong. And he explained it to us and says, why do that? You know.

01:36:34:28 - Patricia McDaniel: Do you do you feel that the that the idea of mutual respect you for your children and your children, for you is stronger in the Mexican culture than it is in the fight?

01:36:48:27 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh, 98%. 98%. I think my Mexican culture, any time. Oh yes. Yeah. You know and and that and now white culture is too much of a mess. Respect the children, don't respect the fathers. If they respect it, they respect it because they got a bunch of money from them for a little while. They run out of money.

01:37:22:09 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They go back to father and start, all over again. I don't say, all of them, but, full pretty high percentage.

01:37:33:06 - Patricia McDaniel: But there is but the respect, the high level of respect for parents, for their children and children, for their parents is stronger.

01:37:42:25 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: in Mexico. Oh, yes. Yes, I can say that here. I can say it in the white House. Yes.

01:37:50:20 - Patricia McDaniel: Do you feel that the family structure is stronger in the Mexican. Yes.

01:37:55:11 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes yes, yes. It's not so much. Liberty. The, the like Mexican mothers, they stick with their kids and

01:38:16:09 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Teaching them the and growing by the years and trying to get him away from troubles and all this I say that percentage they're careless, you know, and they they they they do the same thing, you know, like, Anglos, their own tradition with their kids, with kids, you know, they don't they just don't care. I seem like the kid comes in and says that I want the money, as then I ain't got no more.

01:38:54:11 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I want money, you know, that kid won't won't stop and ask him no more. He. He wants that money. No explanation, no nothing, you see, because the kid goes, ha! Where he goes and get trouble. Okay. And then. And the father, mother, the Anglo father, my monthly, the highest person. And they got job, they got money and all that to get together with that kid and take him for.

01:39:24:12 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And they belong for them to take that kid and break. He's thinking about getting wild. Yeah. And go and get drunk and. And what happened? They call him that. He got killed on the road, that the car rolled up and all that. Well, this becoming on the Mexican, American, the same thing.

01:39:48:00 - Patricia McDaniel: I was going. Yes, I happen to be Mexican American.

01:39:51:11 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes. Because of the miserable dope. Everyone that that they get in trouble and wrecks and all this and that is either an alcohol or a dope related, you know, that is not the tradition that they, they, they come from is that they learning in the schools and the schools and not Mexican tradition either. You know, see, so they they learn to be wild.

01:40:26:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They learn to be free from the father, the father and mother. They don't have no dual restrictions. What so ever. You know, if, the father, like he used to hang out with when I grow up, my father says, see this whip? I never want to use it on you. Just don't never disobey me. Never disobey me. And you know I will never use on.

01:40:53:14 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I disobey him one time, and I have curse right here. I run away from him, and he had the whip in his hand. And he goes like this to, you know, to me, you know, to to to wreck my. And, the, the point that we hit me in and went through my clothes and skin.

01:41:18:27 - Patricia McDaniel: You know.

01:41:19:14 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And then I stopped very quick. And that was the only time in life that he'd done that. So I, he used to tell us, he says, don't obey me. And anything because I don't want to do something I ran away from I was but I was younger, 13 years old. But that was old enough to understand better. I did after that to be.

01:41:42:21 - Patricia McDaniel: Old enough not to do it again.

01:41:45:02 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes.

01:41:46:13 - Patricia McDaniel: And that is, you know, that is, good. I it just my own sense tells me that that's very strong Hispanic cultural, thing to be very close to the family and, and disrespect. And then of course, the, the, the obedience comes from that respect for the direct. Yes, but it, it, you feel that it's eroding as the, as the Mexican-American child becomes more American.

01:42:18:22 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yes.

01:42:19:03 - Patricia McDaniel: More and more more of the angle. ways of doing that. can you recall some of this talk just a little bit about cultural events here in Idaho. Can you recall some of the very early Mexican cultural events that happened here in Idaho the other day? You were talking about the little town that you came to live in when you first moved here.

01:42:42:12 - Patricia McDaniel: What was the name of that?

01:42:43:15 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Aberdeen.

01:42:44:03 - Patricia McDaniel: Aberdeen? Were there any Mexican-American cultural events there in Aberdeen?

01:42:48:27 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: No, no, I think, when we got there, there was only about three families, you know, in there. And, And the job is, is so, so much when we got up there, we got a big bunch of people, us and then some other. We didn't. We know each other because they live on the ranches and everybody's working every day.

01:43:18:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Long hours. You know, we never come to town or or get together, like you said. Go like on the 60 was Cinco de Mayo or on 16 in September. We just let that go because we were nobody. We didn't have no backbone there. Like we say, a leaders do say, hey, we want to get together, we want to do this.

01:43:40:01 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: We're going to try to do this. You know.

01:43:42:22 - Patricia McDaniel: Not it never.

01:43:43:13 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Did. Not enough.

01:43:44:11 - Patricia McDaniel: Bad start. Did it ever happen in Aberdeen. Did you ever have that in everything. How did you come to that.

01:43:50:00 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And no, I don't I don't remember because the last time I was in Aberdeen that, just before I, when I come out of the service in 1946, I went back in 1947 for, for one of these, I think, was Cinco de Mayo a couple of days and all that with nothing moving, just, a dog by that time, the the, the Mercado family and the other one passed, the last name passed.

01:44:27:27 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And these penas several, you know, they were living it all. They get together and they had little tamales and they had just in the house or on the porch someplace, you know, and and they, they drink little beer and, and eat tamales, and the kids play ball over there in the front yard and all that. But there was no, like a public, doing thing.

01:44:53:21 - Patricia McDaniel: It was there's a, there's a lot of that here in Nampa and in Caldwell. When did it start and who started it?

01:45:01:03 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh, I started did you. Yeah.

01:45:03:27 - Patricia McDaniel: Tell me about the first time that you organize the culture. Oh was it what what holiday was it?

01:45:10:27 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: that was, 1919, 57 I start, Getting together the the the labor camps, you know, to celebrate.

01:45:29:07 - Patricia McDaniel: What holiday?

01:45:30:20 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: the 16th of September, 1607. what I did here, I was working for the employment office. The employment office. I work for employment now for five years. They put a sign over there. I've got two pictures where it was a branch from the from the, employment office in in Nampa. I was working as a barber and farmers, they called me, and they put their application for so many men that they went to minimart, and I had them over here all the time and looking.

01:46:04:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And when they knew that I get jobs over here, you know, they they would come. And, since I see so many, you know, they come in the summer, as I said, you know, these people and they, they I don't have some telling, you know, like dancing girls and, musicians and and all kinds, you know, for. You know.

01:46:35:25 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I sit down and, I kind of put names. Colwell, Nyssa, Ontario, Wieser, Caldwell, Nampa, hoon, Dale. And then a hill on 12th Avenue labor camp.

I got a trailer with a flatbed and and I got these and that, you know, beautiful, beautiful.

01:53:05:09 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, okay, so I was one of the programs. I was, I kind of, Or, sorry, a clowns guy, you know, I, I do, I, I supposed to be the first one to cheer the people I did, you know, the girl was there, was helping me. She was real good. She was a professional, you know, and, nobody knew me until I took all these things that I had on me.

01:53:37:01 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You know? Well, anyway, the dance start the next day, the the the news media called me. They they went out there and I didn't know. And they, they took all kinds of pictures, all kinds of pictures, you know, and then they, they they reached me and they told me that there was little over 7000 people gather in that.

01:54:12:02 - Patricia McDaniel: And this was the first one first.

01:54:14:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And we continue, I done it for five years. See, until after five years, you know, my business was growing so big, you know, that I, I knew I was neglecting it, and I didn't, but it come one guy from California.

01:54:39:28 - Unknown: so my wife, Raul Ramos.

01:54:45:09 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: He was he was with the employment office, too, over there.

01:54:50:11 - Patricia McDaniel: In California.

01:54:51:09 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And California, they I think it was in Sacramento, you know, and that to to help me. And I said, I don't, I don't think I won't be able to, to, to do anything except give you an advice here and there. I said, I want you to take over. You know, he got together and the first one, he made it almost identical physically.

01:55:20:05 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: And I was very, very pleased. But, the second year, you know, something went wrong. Something you know, the people don't want to cooperate with you. You know, they come here and and and we said, we want you to. And then they went, A little sour. And then the third year.

01:55:53:03 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: The third year, there was another man over here from labor camp. He wants to he he got it. He done real good. He done real good, too. But he die on us. He went back to Eagle Pass and and, we got a phone call. I got a phone call that he had done. Yes. This man died in a heart attack.

01:56:21:18 - Patricia McDaniel: But that's how was he was was started by you. The recognition, was started by you and then, you know, and after five years into this.

01:56:30:17 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: All right. Yes.

01:56:33:15 - Patricia McDaniel: Well, Tony, tell me something. We don't have very much tape left. Let's go finish. Tell me, what do you feel about how the future will be for the Mexican American here in Idaho? What does the future hold? How will it clean?

01:56:51:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: I say that it's a good. It's a good, trail for the Mexican American in Idaho, Oregon and, in the state surrounding Washington. Because, like I say, the schooling and, and the majority of the of the, of the Mexican people, you know, work, don't scare them. I hear this from, from my Anglo bosses all the time.

01:57:28:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They get, to work. And those they, they stay working. They don't cry so much. If they get paid $0.50 less than the others, they just stay there until when they, Well, with good opportunity, they come out and say, ask you after 4 or 5 years, probably for a race, you know, they entitled to little race or something like that and, but, fathers, jobs even today, right now, even the, the uneducated which as long as they know English, they're good job that, that, that the Anglos don't like it.

01:58:17:12 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They go and get it. See. So I say with education it would be more or less more opportunity. There will be no, no, black in the future. more, more chance for the white than it is for the Mexican descent. No. Because, I seen in in the schools and I see it all over these, Mexicans and Anglos in the state of Idaho.

01:58:49:20 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They're putting words together.

01:58:51:29 - Patricia McDaniel: Do you think that the Mexican culture will, or the Mexican American people will be able to hold their culture together?

01:58:59:02 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Oh, yes. Yes.

01:59:01:24 - Patricia McDaniel: Because it won't get lost in the Anglo.

01:59:05:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, if it get lost, if, Well, I can say, it can get lost. Like, for instance, I'm here today and my, my kids, they're being here tomorrow. You know what? I'm what I mean, within 25, 30 years, my kids, well, they don't know as much as I do my own kids. I do about my culture, their kids.

01:59:35:03 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: They ain't got to know almost nothing. So that's going to be staying behind unless they somebody coming from the South, with all this knowledge about the culture and practices here in the state, right. See, or any place.

01:59:53:11 - Patricia McDaniel: So in other words, the culture will remain alive. There's always somebody who is very rude to the culture or brings the culture with them and renews it.

02:00:03:07 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Yeah, well, it's happening. It's happening today. They're bringing it up, you know, like you think like these, Johnny Kanellis, he he brings those beautiful music musicians, you know, to, to show it to the Mexican people over here. And if, if you ever have, chance to talk to this, Gilberto Flores, the guy who owns the the multipurpose, what they call the those skilled workers.

02:00:36:04 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: You can go there one night. Okay, maybe I can give you a, I'll give him a talk and tell him and then let you go in, because every time he he cha. It's going to be a matter from 15 to $25. Because he brings he brings the music that plays around, around Veronica Castro. You know, on that show that she she saw that she got.

02:01:04:12 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Well, those musicians is the one he brings here. So they cost a lot of money. And the people over here want it. You know, one time and two days, I sold, $1,600 that, you know, tickets for him.

02:01:21:15 - Patricia McDaniel: That he was going to Florida. He's the one who has it who's come closer.

02:01:26:25 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: See. And, if you go there and you see the multitude of people and the way they dance their local beers and things like that, you know, sometimes you get a terrible time to get in it. So Pat you have to pay.

02:01:46:08 - Patricia McDaniel: Yeah. Well I have to look into that. Thank you so much. It has really been so nice to have you talk and to listen to.

02:01:58:26 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: is it's so many other things to talk about to, you.

02:02:48:19 - Antonio (Tony) Hernandez Rodriguez: Always the people they. Yes, nominate me for, for that position. And, this is what I, I like to, to pass it on to. And some of the kids, they're going to start school, you know that I consider me I didn't know nothing. But when I really get into the office and start reading and finding out, you can develop, that, you can work it out the best way you can and the purest way you, you, you work it the people around like it.
