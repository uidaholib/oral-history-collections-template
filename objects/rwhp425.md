00;26;52;18 - Lillian Thompson:: Well, we moved out here because we just thought it'd be great happening here with work.

00;26;58;06 - Unknown:: At that time. so that's why we get.

00;27;05;09 - Unknown Interviewer:: Correct. Do you know any women who live in an urban area? Big city. Would you? How would you compare your live there?

00;27;14;04 - Lillian Thompson:: Well, I have a sister law move down was saying.

00;27;17;20 - Unknown Interviewer:: That.

00;27;17;24 - Lillian Thompson:: For your.

00;27;21;14 - Lillian Thompson:: And she doesn't like this country at all. She runs everything right at the touch of her finger, you know, press the button here, button there. Everything is smart enough to date, but she doesn't like everything's up here because we live according to.

00;27;38;28 - Unknown Interviewer:: Would you like to live like she can? No.

00;27;41;26 - Lillian Thompson:: I don't like. Yeah. I wouldn't change my life for all of California.

00;27;51;01 - Lillian Thompson:: No, I don't think I would care if it moved down there. I just don't care for that. I've been through Los Angeles, but as far as, like, a baby.

00;28;02;15 - Unknown:: No, I would never.

00;28;08;13 - Unknown Interviewer:: how did, when your children grew up, how was their life different from yours when you were growing up? I wasn't about to say. Well.

00;28;20;07 - Lillian Thompson:: Our children more or less had to work, but, you know, we made of get jobs and help with the income. I didn't feel it was right and that I could grow up and not have have something to do, do. And then when they were in school, when you're going to in high school, they earned their own money and got their own.

00;28;40;22 - Lillian Thompson:: The college. But Marilyn Monroe was terrible, but she had a job, but she could, you know, live it up and not have to work for what her.

00;28;52;14 - Unknown Interviewer:: Different from other children in the neighborhood.

00;28;56;07 - Lillian Thompson:: I think her voice. yeah. I think our boys got more of a big job than other boys. Really? I think they did what they could best known that I think they were. And then the other big thing, because a lot of the parents had the money to give their children where we just didn't have. You know, where my husband worked for all his life, for the girls.

00;29;25;01 - Lillian Thompson:: Well, you get paid when they stay home in the long.

00;29;30;07 - Unknown Interviewer:: They sound like you probably would have required them to have responsibilities even if you'd been able to.

00;29;35;28 - Lillian Thompson:: Afford. Yes. I feel that any child growing up could have responsibility and part of their development that I mean that to me. I think that's what's wrong with for most the children today is the parents give giving $10 per hour going out and find something to do. Now this is I have the same situation with my sister up there in Spokane, though they her children were very different than ours and they have more income.

00;30;08;24 - Lillian Thompson:: But her husband had a better job and a steady income. But I know understand what the difference. But really, in comparison, our children turned out just as good, if not better. Since I was on the money.

00;30;21;06 - Unknown Interviewer:: I think I could have maybe some advantages for having had that experience at work.

00;30;26;03 - Lillian Thompson:: If they went to college, their children had the chance to go to college for our boys. Did they learn what they they're building? Their jobs today? They learned the hard way. Okay. So I guess working at it. So I feel like in a long way, they didn't need a college education to get where they are today.

00;30;51;11 - Unknown Interviewer:: And you feel like they did as well. Yeah.

00;30;54;02 - Lillian Thompson:: I think our youngest son.

00;30;56;15 - Unknown Interviewer:: Is in the Caribbean.

00;30;57;20 - Lillian Thompson:: He started out when he was 14 years old. He took Mastercard down the filling station and he came from there, try to work on up, change, big trip cars and all night. He liked mechanics. They worked on their own car and overhauled their cars, and they grown up in both. The boys are real good at mechanic. They don't take their cars into a garage that works out to them.

00;31;28;12 - Unknown Interviewer:: So that's very good. So you know, today you're going to, pretty much the way you were. You grew up with this kind of experience where.

00;31;40;16 - Lillian Thompson:: Yeah, we I didn't know, you know, we had to learn things at hand and we had to learn to drive when we were real young. I remember when I was only about six, I'm only been about 6 or 7 years old. I go out in the field with my dad. See, we are no.

00;31;57;27 - Unknown Interviewer:: Ma'am.

00;31;58;07 - Lillian Thompson:: He truck, you know, and it's the time that you put in the collection early to get it to go on where we get this thing of going inside before I get to the gate, all they're doing shut off the keys. But I graduated from the field and cabins I could connect. I got to, I couldn't shift and or anything.

00;32;19;15 - Lillian Thompson:: All it did was just start putting over here. well, how many kids did this kid do? Things like that?

00;32;30;15 - Unknown Interviewer:: Right. They have to get a license in order to learn.

00;32;32;14 - Lillian Thompson:: Well, this is through a club field.

00;32;37;12 - Unknown Interviewer:: all right, some of the things I've already talked about. Some things you just spent working or what did you have? Recreation. What'd you do for recreation?

00;32;47;22 - Lillian Thompson:: Well, we belong to both. My sister and I belong on the basketball team. You know, for four years through high school. And then we cook baseball, and we had a regular club to school. That team, you know, at over at and Stanley. And they had rooms and horses. So we weren't lacking for things to do.

00;33;12;12 - Unknown Interviewer:: but you did have time for records here. An opportunity.

00;33;16;07 - Lillian Thompson:: The girls did that. Not all our. Oh.

00;33;28;03 - Unknown Interviewer:: my first year.

00;33;31;12 - Lillian Thompson:: That that was pretty scary for the boys. Be careful for school. Now, if there's something to be done, like they would take money from school when those girls are. Okay, but we lots of time, you know, to go into basketball games or something like that. We had to ride horses five miles. So seven something different. Yeah. You know, five miles from school.

00;34;00;13 - Unknown Interviewer:: Did you ever walk over here?

00;34;02;19 - Lillian Thompson:: And many a time we walked home from school. We didn't have to walk in the mornings to go to school, but we walked in.

00;34;10;23 - Unknown Interviewer:: With someone taking in.

00;34;12;03 - Lillian Thompson:: Or in our day. I was in school, not working years as volunteer. sled came in. Sled? Yeah.

00;34;22;29 - Unknown Interviewer:: And then you'd walk home.

00;34;26;10 - Lillian Thompson:: One morning, the whole family, except my younger brother, they, you know, we were then my younger brother Johnny was just a baby. And then going to school, my dad grade school, train and I bet missed that train. It just go over the track and the train, like, for about a mile before they put that cross. And I said, I'll never forget that.

00;34;56;02 - Lillian Thompson:: But all of us were in that little jumper slide. You know, it could be the pulling any of that but a crock just a minute on that rail or I, the whole family's been killed. There was a Caucasus birthday, I birthday it was. I remember the weather came down this year. It was kind of just, you know, down into the, for the railroad track.

00;35;27;05 - Lillian Thompson:: Can't walk up the banks there, you know, and you could see it coming. So I think he thought he had plenty of time. but he didn't either. He just. I was that carried. After that, every one of those kids would go climb under the bed and the train would go to go it it just it scared of the death.

00;35;47;20 - Unknown Interviewer:: To come on the back of the day. Yeah. What did you think when your children were growing up? What kind of recreation?

00;35;55;19 - Lillian Thompson:: Or. They were involved in school. Okay, well, while we got some up in school in the summertime. See, back there, mostly they had everything, you know, everything was free. Bet your swimming lessons and everything. All you have to do is take children to the park, throw them in different so the boys could go up until they got into Boy Scouts and then they well, we got to work in a fair and too much schoolwork.

00;36;31;05 - Lillian Thompson:: So we had to go off that they didn't go. I don't know how far they would to go. That's one thing. I always kept them very, very high level, very good. I would go things to do, going for, doing things around town. So they were always kept busy. Area. If you.

00;36;57;01 - Unknown Interviewer:: Feel. Doing thing is a family like camping or gardening or.

00;37;04;05 - Lillian Thompson:: Or we would grow. We belong to one club back there. Mom and I belong to those back there. But every 4th of July the whole family would get together. We broke the bank up in the mountains and had our pick, which they don't do nowadays.

00;37;21;10 - Unknown Interviewer:: Are kind of fallen out.

00;38;02;01 - Lillian Thompson:: Well, I think this group, the crew was more like the people I knew when I was a girl. They were more down to earth people, and they were hard to figure out what they were as far doing things for people that think this community is so wonderful, you know, and they will help people. Now there happens to be a flier or something.

00;38;29;21 - Lillian Thompson:: They will go ahead and make that thing. You know, they go somewhere and do things for the family. Or if there's someone past the way, they'll fix a big dinner.
