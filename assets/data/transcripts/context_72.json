So I live back East, where John Denver's music about the Rockies in Colorado did not necessarily connect in that urban setting so much. And that's where most of the rock critics and music critics lived. And so John Denver never had, I don't think, a decent shot at convincing the hardcore, New York based urban music critics of the validity of his music, and so he had routinely had to fight, negative reviews or people just saying, oh, man, lightweight, lightweight.",

And it's a new generation of younger, music critics and journalists who now basically sit in the same seats that we once did at magazines like rolling Stone, etc. and they have a different view.",

Because as we'll see in just a minute or so, he really comes up as a folk singer during a whole folk revival of the early and mid 1960s, and therefore it's an easy place to put him.

That's why it happens. But I am here to tell you, and I know this for a fact. Musicians hate it. And I'm sure John Denver did too, because even though he did draw from country, particularly his influences, and even though there were folk roots in his music as well, and even though he was a pop singer as well, he was all of this, he was all of this and maybe even a little bit more as we'll see.",

    "description": "John Denver was one of America’s greatest country-folk singer-songwriters. With over 30 albums, he was more than a performer—he was an actor, environmentalist, and humanitarian. His music captured everyday life with deep conviction, especially in 'Take Me Home, Country Roads,' now one of West Virginia’s four state anthems. Bio: Robert Santelli was named Executive Director of the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles in 2006. Under his leadership, the Museum opened new locations, curated over 65 exhibits, produced 600+ public programs, and partnered with the White House and The Kennedy Center for education. A noted blues and rock historian, Santelli has contributed to Rolling Stone and The New York Times and authored over a dozen books, including the New York Times bestsellers Greetings From E Street and The Bob Dylan Scrapbook. He was an original curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and its first Director of Education and VP of Public Programs. In 2000, he became CEO of Seattle’s Experience Music Project (now MoPOP), the first interactive music museum. He also developed the UK’s first pop music museum, the British Music Experience. In 2012, Santelli co-produced Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection, earning a GRAMMY® nomination. After the GRAMMY Museum merged with the GRAMMY Foundation in 2017, he was named Founding Executive Director and now oversees its traveling exhibits and external projects.",
