There's a statue there today. And George Washington, after he took the oath of office, he actually kissed the Bible. And there were fireworks to celebrate it. But because there was a pressing business, there was no inaugural ball held after George Washington's, inauguration, after he took the oath of office and his wife didn't even attend.",

But because this was the first transfer of power from one political party to another political party, that was contentious, America was divided. Again, this is a very important time in the history of the United States, because political scientists will tell you that you don't have a true democracy until you have the transfer of power from one party to an opposing party, and then to some other opposing party after that.",

So Jefferson represents this first transfer of power from from the, Washington, Adams kind of political party to the Jefferson Union political party. And it was contentious. So it's there's some notable firsts. It's the first inauguration that happens in Washington, DC.",

Thomas Jefferson, although he was really powerful in writing, did not enjoy public speaking very much. And so, he began this custom where he would write down, he would he would write to Congress, and I think that given the context of this first transfer of power from one party to another, I think that some of the text of his inaugural address becomes important to think about.",

Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We've been called by different names, brethren, of the same principle. We're all Republicans, we're all Federalists. And so Jefferson, in his short inaugural address, attempts to unite the country and to reassure the opposing side that even though they've lost, they're still going to be represented and he's still going to be their president of the United States.",

After elections that we contest, elections we fight. It might be bitter, but then after the election, we come together. So I think that the, the first inaugural from Thomas Jefferson is important because it does set the precedent that's followed almost all of the time in the United States that the inaugural but when the president takes the oath of office is a time for Americans to come together and to set aside their differences and to try to work together, to look for commonality, to try to seek for things that, that unite",

The, the, the presidential approval rating on the day of inauguration is always higher than the percentage of the votes that the president receives in the preceding election. So in that interim, in that time between the election and the inauguration, usually what happens is Americans come together and they sort of set aside their differences and they say, let's give the new president a chance.",

Andrew Jackson represents that second transfer of power so that the Jeffersonian Democrats are in power for a long period of time. The 1824 election is very contentious. Andrew Jackson won the plurality.",

He feels like he should be the president of the United States. And the House of Representatives gave it to somebody else. So, again, the 1828 presidential election is very contentious.

So there's a lot of bitterness between the outgoing John Quincy Adams and the incoming Andrew Jackson. It's it's kind of common, in democracies, when power is transferring from, from one to, in one party to another, a new regime is coming in that there's going to be that kind of tension.",

    "description": "Although the US constitution dedicates relatively little space to the executive branch, it is specific about the Oath a president must take. Over the last two centuries, the inaugural ceremony accompanying the formal oath of office has varied quite a lot. From people who were inebriated and rambled through the speech, to people who spoke so long they became ill; I will discuss some interesting and politically important inaugurations. In addition, I will discuss who typically gets an invitation to inaugurations and how this impacts Idahoans. Bio: Matthew Miles is a professor of Political Science at BYU-Idaho where he teaches undergraduate courses on the Executive Branch and a longtime member of the Presidents and Executive Politics section of the American Political Science Association. He has authored a book and more than a dozen peer-reviewed articles. His research on the Executive Branch has been published in Public Administration Review , Policy Studies Journal , The International Journal of Press/Politics, and Presidential Studies Quarterly .",
