But dad had already everything arranged for her. She was, they had a home. And the other people that lived in the little community were all, well, not all of them, but probably 80% were were of Mexican descent.",mexico
Ofilia Ramos,[00:12:22:03],00:12:40:23,"So they didn't have any problem with the language because the, the judges spoke excellent, Spanish. The doctors, the, policemen or whatever, you know, all all of the people spoke Spanish.",spain

Ofilia Ramos,[00:14:15:02],00:14:38:09,"Well, probably the one at Parker, because I don't know. She stands in my mind because she gave me a little, a little golden book. And I thought that was the best thing that ever happened. And, and I did learn to read it, and I think I was only in the first grade then, and that was real neat.",idaho;education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:14:38:11],00:14:39:23,That was for me.,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:14:39:25],00:14:48:20,How did you feel when you came into the Air Force school then? You didn't know any English.,education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:14:48:22],00:15:15:12,"I the only thing I remember, I remember two occasions, one, I was sitting in a circle and now I know why. Why it was the probably the reading, the reading time. I didn't know what was going on, but I was sitting in a circle and, listening to the other people read. And then another time at the same school at, Emerson, I'm pretty sure it's on Third Street.",education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:15:15:12],00:15:43:25,"Emerson. And, there was this little girl and I. And there was a little boy, you know, all the same age. And I said something and she giggled. The other little girl giggled, and the teacher was standing. It was just there, close by, that she could hear what I said. To this day I don't know what I said, but I got reprimanded for whatever I said.",education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:15:43:28],00:16:02:27,"I didn't know what and she didn't take time. The only thing the teacher told me was, a little girl shouldn't say that. Well, that's great, but I. I don't know what I said wrong. I'm.",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:16:03:00],00:16:13:13,"How do you think education opportunities for Mexican-Americans in Idaho, changed in your lifetime?",education;idaho
Ofilia Ramos,[00:16:13:15],00:16:44:05,"Well, when I first graduated in 1961 from Idaho Falls High. I don't think it probably was. Overall, I don't think there was a lot of government grants. And the only way you could go if you go to college, I wanted to go to college, but the only way you could go was either your parents paid for you, of course they needed to have money or you got scholarships.",idaho
Ofilia Ramos,[00:16:44:08],00:17:19:02,"And and the only, the only thing with scholarships is that you have to be, I mean, real smart, or at least your grades had to reflect that you were real smart. And mine weren't that that great. But I still wanted to go to school. And then later on, 15 maybe later on. It did get better. And I think it is better because I myself went to school under a grant and I, I really appreciate that.",education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:17:19:02],00:17:27:21,"And I try to work with other young people when I do have, the opportunity or the time to work with them.",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:17:27:23],00:17:38:04,"Do you think that, I hope Mexican-Americans do well in school.",education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:17:38:06],00:18:20:14,"Oh, I. By the reports I see and I hear they're not doing too well yet. It's. I think they're odd. The the figures have improved, I think more kids, more Hispanic kids. Mexican-Americans are staying in school because their parents are educated. And the ones that are educated, they are staying in school. And I think it's improved. But you're you still have the problem with, with the laborers, with the migrant workers, and that hasn't I don't think that has improved it too much.",education;migration
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:18:20:16],00:18:29:10,Describe your first job that you had out of working with them at the Farmers place when you were here in Idaho?,idaho

Ofilia Ramos,[00:18:56:17],00:19:11:14,"And I was going to secretarial school at night, so I'm rolling. And, they treated me good there. I, I worked, oh, maybe six, seven months.",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:19:11:17],00:19:19:14,How did your parents feel about you graduating from high school and then getting a job and going to secretary school at the same time?,education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:19:19:17],00:19:51:06,"Well, they thought that was pretty neat. They really. My both my father and mother, wanted us. The children, to be educated because they knew that without education, without knowing the language. Well, you know, it just doesn't hold your future. Doesn't look too good. And so they really the they really pushed for the education. My father learned to read and write by himself.",family;education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:19:51:08],00:20:06:16,"Like a lot of people, probably back in the Old West, I call it, they learned by themselves. And my mom also could read a little bit. She didn't know how to write, but she didn't know how to read a little bit.",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:20:06:18],00:20:09:27,Or other kinds of jobs that you have.,

And I've also been a secretary for many, many years, and I've worked for the Nampa School District as, a teacher's aide and also a teacher. And I have a degree in, bilingual education that I'm very proud of, at the press.

Ofilia Ramos,[00:21:02:19],00:21:25:00,"Yeah. If the teaching I think is my would be the ideal. But because for financial reasons, the technician job holds a little more promise financially. But, my love, I think, is teaching.",

Ofilia Ramos,[00:21:36:16],00:22:12:12,"From. I think it, probably makes a difference where you're working now where I work for EG&G. And that's a very, it's a big company and they have all kinds of methods to, make, make sure that your rights are protected. They have in your office and it's, it's quite good. And, but there are less fortunate people I know.",
Ofilia Ramos,[00:22:12:14],00:22:32:00,"I don't know of any incidents myself, but I'm sure that, that they are treated fairly. But, since I've worked for the school district and for the and for now for this company, I haven't had that problem.",education

Ofilia Ramos,[00:22:44:17],00:23:14:01,"Well, I think what brought me back home was my folks know first. My mom passed away, and then my dad moved back to Idaho Falls for the Maine family, where most of the family were are here. And then, just other things in my own private life that happened to me that I decided I, I tried, I tried working at the for the initial and it's been very good to me.",idaho;family

My dad was very, not standoffish in a in a bad way, but I think because he didn't know the language, he rather stay home. But my mom was, different. She was very outgoing. And, as a family, we would they would get us all kids in the pickup, bring us into town.",family
Ofilia Ramos,[00:26:15:19],00:26:52:06,"And this, you have to think, was 40 years ago or so, and probably one movie house, and we would all go to the movies to Sunday or Saturday matinee, and. But my mom like westerns a lot, and so that's what they did.
