And that's one of the reasons that I think the decade is so fascinating because there's so many student run publications on the scene, but no one has quite figured out yet what to do with them, what they should look like, how they should be run and operated, and how they should be controlled, should the content be censored.",

So spelling, grammar, writing with lessons you might be learning in civics or history about how to be a good citizen and what information, what information did people need to know in order to be active and engaged and well-informed citizens in a democracy?",

So at this point in time, high schools are moving away from focusing solely on a college preparatory, liberal arts oriented curriculum to what we call a comprehensive curriculum.",

So as part of that, they tried to introduce classes like auto repair, sewing, stenography, but also printing and print production. So even if a school didn't have a print shop and I will say many more did, than you would think, the newspaper, in the process of putting it together, still satisfied some of those educational outcomes for those more manual arts and vocational oriented classes.",

And again, a lot of this is because these are really tricky products. Student newspapers tended not to succeed unless you had student buy. And so students needed to think the paper was important.",

So these weren't necessarily initially advertising supported publications. But, faculty and administrators in particular were somewhat reluctant to give free rein to the students to determine what content went into the newspaper. So while there was this, again, this belief that, yes, this is an essential part of a modern high school, there were a lot of questions to be worked out over.",

So moving away from like literature analysis to purely focusing on spelling, grammar and composition. And her big complaint was that to do that really undermined the educational mission of the high school, but it also prevented all of the students from pursuing certain educational opportunities, whether they were college bound or not, to not expose them to literature was to really limit their futures.",

And again, just because something doesn't grapple with big questions doesn't make it valuable for our historical understanding. I enjoyed reading the strike newspapers and these really well-written and well articulated arguments against what this school board is doing. Just as much as I enjoyed reading jokes that I did not understand, from the 1920s about dumb things freshmen did in the school cafeteria, so sometimes we can try to think only in terms of these big, important stuff, these things, and we miss that.",

    "description": "Dr. Caitlin Cieslik-Miskimen joins Johanna to talk about how valuable student newspapers and yearbooks are to study American history. Caitlin Cieslik-Miskimen is an assistant professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Media. She received her Ph.D. in Mass Communication and History from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and joined the University of Idaho faculty in 2019. In addition to media history, she teaches courses in public relations and strategic communications. As a media historian, she explores the cultural role that print products played in communities in the early 20th century. Part of Dr. Cieslik-Miskimen’s research has focused on media coverage of American high schools and the origins of high school journalism. She recently published a book chapter, \" A Window into the World of Students: An Analysis of 1920s High School Student Newspapers ,\" and is currently working on a journal article about media coverage of high school student protests in the 1920s.",
