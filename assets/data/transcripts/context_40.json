Now, I wouldn't necessarily say that we've seen changes in the sizes of either the Democrat or the Republican Party, or necessarily the composition of the parties. So we haven't seen one group really get pulled over to, a one specific demographic group get pulled over and really high concentrations to the other, party.",

Okay. now you might be wondering like, oh, this is actually really interesting to me. could I read anything more on this? So a few things would be the Partizan sought by, Matthew Levandowski.
