And so, you know, many of the world's longest and oldest film franchises are in Japan, but very few of them have made the leap, to, American audiences. One reason is because many of those Japanese film franchises are comedic, and nothing translates as poorly as comedy, right?",

    "description": "Since Godzilla’s debut nearly 70 years ago in Gojira, the King of the Monsters has become a global icon and a symbol of Japan. But what can a fire-breathing movie monster reveal about Japanese culture and history? This talk explores how the 33 Godzilla films reflect Japan’s resilience in the face of disaster, the worldwide appeal of Japanese creature features, and how societies confront fears of invisible threats, from radiation to pandemics. Bios: Bill Tsutsui specializes in the economic, environmental, and cultural history of modern Japan. Educated at Harvard, Oxford, and Princeton, he has authored or edited eight books, including Manufacturing Ideology and Japanese Popular Culture and Globalization. His 2004 book Godzilla on My Mind was called a 'cult classic' by The New York Times. Tsutsui has received Fulbright, ACLS, and Marshall Fellowships, and won the John Whitney Hall Prize and the William Rockhill Nelson Prize for Non-Fiction. He has served on the boards of the Association for Asian Studies, the US-Japan Council, and the Federation of State Humanities Councils. From 2014 to 2019, he was President of Hendrix College and is now Professor Emeritus of History. His research focuses on Japanese environmental and popular culture history. Lisa M. Brady is a History professor at Boise State University, specializing in global, Asian, and environmental history. Her research explores how military activities shape the environment.

Brady was editor-in-chief of Environmental History from 2013-2019 and became History Department chair in 2021.",
