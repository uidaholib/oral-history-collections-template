    "description": "During the 20th century, hundreds of communities in the American West vanished due to river development projects—massive dams built for irrigation, hydroelectricity, and flood control. These projects displaced towns, tribal communities, farms, and ranches along the Snake, Colorado, and Columbia Rivers. The Atlas of Drowned Towns (drownedtowns.com) is a multimedia public history project dedicated to recovering these lost histories. This talk explores its objectives and key questions: How did displaced communities react—with enthusiasm, acquiescence, or resistance? Why? What was it like to leave these places behind? And what can we learn from these histories as we face future displacement? Bio: Bob H. Reinhardt is an associate professor of history at Boise State University, specializing in the American West, environmental history, public history, and public health. He is the author of The End of a Global Pox: America and the Eradication of Smallpox in the Cold War Era (UNC Press) and Struggle on the North Santiam: Power and Community on the Margins of the American West (Oregon State University Press). He previously served as Executive Director of the Willamette Heritage Center museum in Salem, Oregon, held a postdoctoral fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University, and taught at Western Oregon and Willamette Universities. He is also the founder and director of the Working History Center at Boise State.",
