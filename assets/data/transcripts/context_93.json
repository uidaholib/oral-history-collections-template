And the ritual was intended to honor both the general who had achieved the victory, and also the gods who had helped him to achieve that victory. But there were a number of requirements that a general had to meet, because while this is a celebratory parade, it is one that you had to be granted by the Senate, and by by majority of the Senate.",

As the Roman Empire expanded in the second century BC, in particular, the Roman Senate found so many people applying for, wanting a triumph for whatever military conquest that they had that they had achieved, but they were sometimes actually leaving in the middle of a military campaign to put it back to Rome in order to apply for a triumph.",

They left it vague enough that basically, as long as they liked you, they would give you, one of these parades. Most importantly, though, with that decisive, the requirement for it to be a decisive battle meant that it couldn't be a civil war.",

All those things show up on, on Roman coins, and then they're sent out into the provinces via the armies because they pay the army, and the army is the one doing the conquering. And we do see in the later republic, as these provinces are starting to develop their own independent identity and become and are starting to petition for Roman citizenship, they start using those symbols that had once been sort of symbols of their of their subjugation by the Romans to actually show that they are members of a peer group.",

    "description": "In the 1920s and 1930s, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini celebrated a number of ancient Roman centennials, coopting Roman imagery and symbolism to inaugurate his own ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù of the Roman Empire. But did these symbols mean the same thing to the ancient Romans that they did to Mussolini? Where did these symbols come from, and what role did they play in the Roman Republic? By tracing the evolution of the Roman triumphal parade in the Roman Republic, this presentation will demonstrate why the triumph was so important in Roman society, explain how it came to underscore and shed light on why this ancient military and religious procession continues to resonate into the modern world. Alyson Roy is an assistant professor of ancient history at the University of Idaho. Her research focuses on the Roman Republic, ancient military history, material culture and numismatics. Her forthcoming book project, Circulating Triumph: Conquest Imagery and its Reception in the Roman Republic , explores the use of triumphal imagery in the provinces to extend and reinforce conquest. She holds a Ph.D. in history from the University of Washington.",
