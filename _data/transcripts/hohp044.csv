Martha Torrez,[00:00:05:16],[00:00:07:15],"Okay, Mr. Vasquez,",
Abel Vasquez,[00:00:07:18],[00:00:09:21],Okay.,
Martha Torrez,[00:00:09:23],[00:00:19:16],Okay. I'd like to begin by just asking you how it is that you and your family came to the state of Idaho.,family;idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:00:19:18],[00:00:40:23],"Well, when we came to Idaho, it was much. I didn't have a choice. It was something I had to do. I was raised by my grandparents, and at the time we came to Idaho, I was only eight years old, so needless to say, I had to come to the state with my folks to work in the fields.",idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:00:40:26],[00:00:43:10],So that is how I came to be in Idaho?,idaho
Martha Torrez,[00:00:43:12],[00:00:45:02],Now you were raised by your grandparents?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:00:45:02],[00:01:21:12],"I was raised by my grandparents due to the fact that my mother died when I was very young. It was a strange story. I guess it's because when my mother and father separated, I was six months old, my mother took my older brother and raised him until she passed away in 1940.",family
Abel Vasquez,[00:01:21:14],[00:01:44:21],"But my grandmother took my older sister, Helen, and myself when we were babies, and as little kids, she raised us. So I was raised by my grandmother from early childhood.",family
Martha Torrez,[00:01:44:23],[00:01:58:14],"And so, when you were living with your grandparents, where were you living? And if you could explain to me a little bit about how it was that you came to be in Idaho.",idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:01:58:17],[00:02:31:03],"How I came to be in Idaho was, we were living in Grand Junction, Colorado, and we were bean field workers. That's all we knew at the time. So we used to follow the field work. How we came to Idaho: my grandmother had a sister who lived in Salt Lake City, and we went from Grand Junction, Colorado, to Salt Lake City to visit my grandmother's sister.",idaho;family;food and drink;recreation
Abel Vasquez,[00:02:31:05],[00:02:59:21],"And we stayed there maybe six months or a year, I can't really recall how long. And that was in 1937 or '38, I think the fall of 1938. In the fall of 1938, my grandfather and some other people decided to come to Idaho because there was field work to do, sugar beets.",family;idaho
Martha Torrez,[00:02:59:23],[00:03:01:09],"So the opportunity, or...",
Abel Vasquez,[00:03:01:09],[00:03:21:20],"Job opportunity arose. And so we came to Preston Idaho, me my grandmother, my sister and my grandfather. We went to Preston Idaho in the fall of 1938.",idaho;family
Martha Torrez,[00:03:21:23],[00:03:28:08],"Did you do any other kind of farm work? Other than beets, did you work in other types of agriculture?",agriculture
Abel Vasquez,[00:03:32:07],[00:03:53:29],"Throughout the years? I remember, when we were little and stayed in Utah, we used to pull onions. I remember Carbon onions, somewhere close to Salt Lake. But when we came to Idaho, the season was to top beets. It was the fall of the year.",food and drink;recreation;idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:03:53:29],[00:04:25:14],"And so we used to meet and camp. We used a knife with a little hook on the end, like a machete, and that's what we did in 1938. We stayed there all winter of 1938. In the spring of '39, we followed the work.",recreation
Abel Vasquez,[00:04:25:16],[00:04:45:21],"So we came to Idaho. Why did we come to Marsing? I'm not really clear whether we knew somebody there or we just happened to say, 'Let’s go to the other part of Idaho, go to Marsing.' But all I know is that we landed in Marsing in 1939. You know, we were here before, they were here.",idaho;marsing
Abel Vasquez,[00:04:45:21],[00:04:47:00],They were here.,
Martha Torrez,[00:04:47:03],[00:04:54:27],"When you traveled to Idaho, did you come by your own transportation that year? And did you come out with other families, or was it just your family?",idaho;family
Abel Vasquez,[00:04:54:27],[00:05:06:13],"It was just my grandparents and us. We didn't know anybody. We were just by ourselves. And when we came to Marsing, I think we were by ourselves also.",marsing
Martha Torrez,[00:05:06:16],[00:05:07:11],So you drove?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:05:07:17],[00:05:33:14],"We drove here. We had, and I think it was an old pickup truck, if I'm not mistaken. But we landed in Marsing, and the ideal situation in those days was to find a farmer who had year-round work, where you could start in the spring, thin the beets, clean them, and then find some work in between. And then in the fall, you topped the beets. And so that's what we did.",marsing
Martha Torrez,[00:05:40:12],[00:05:44:16],What are your very first memories of Idaho when you first got here? What did you think of it?,idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:05:44:18],[00:06:08:19],"Cold, especially in eastern Idaho. It was very, very cold. And, needless to say, working in the fields as a kid, we'd go out to the beet fields, and it was so cold the leaves, the tops from the beets, would break off. They were frozen.",health;idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:06:08:23],[00:06:10:03],It was cold.,health
Martha Torrez,[00:06:10:06],[00:06:12:15],So do you have any idea where you're from originally?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:06:12:18],[00:06:19:23],"No, no, but I like it here. Yeah, it was very cold here.",health
Martha Torrez,[00:06:19:25],[00:06:22:23],I know you said the very first place you came to was Preston.,idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:06:22:23],[00:06:23:13],,
Martha Torrez,[00:06:23:16],[00:06:26:18],Can you describe where you lived?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:06:26:20],[00:06:53:03],"Well, it wasn't long ago, but I'm sure it was just a very small shack, probably just a one-room house that I can remember. We probably had to go to the farmer's house to get water.",
Abel Vasquez,[00:06:53:03],[00:07:06:18],"We didn't have any bathroom facilities, you know, you had an outhouse. Okay, so that's what I recall mostly when I first came to Idaho: that it was cold.",idaho;health
Martha Torrez,[00:07:06:21],[00:07:12:00],"Now, once you got here, did you travel to other cities in Idaho or to other states?",idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:07:12:01],[00:07:38:05],"Once we came to Idaho, we went to Marsing. We stayed in Marsing and worked in Marsing. But while we were in Marsing, we used to go to other areas, like the McCall-Donnelly area to pick peas. We used to go to Emmett to work in the pea fields.",idaho;marsing
Abel Vasquez,[00:07:38:05],[00:07:56:12],"And also, we used to grow carrots there, you could tie carrots in the water in the Emmett area. And I also lived temporarily, maybe two or three months, in a labor camp in Oregon.",idaho;labor;recreation
Martha Torrez,[00:07:56:14],[00:08:01:22],And what was that like?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:08:01:24],[00:08:23:29],"As a kid, if you have your parents, or your grandparents, you don't put too much emphasis on things like we do now. You don't worry about the economics of it. You just work, go to school, and you've got a place to eat and sleep, and you're happy.",education
Abel Vasquez,[00:08:24:06],[00:08:24:24],Okay.,
Martha Torrez,[00:08:24:26],[00:08:26:12],So it was positive for you?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:08:26:15],[00:08:45:20],"Oh, yes, very positive. I remember at that particular time, when we were living in that labor camp, my older brother Rudy got really sick with a constant virus, and he just about died there. But, needless to say, he didn't.",labor;recreation;family;health
Martha Torrez,[00:08:45:27],[00:08:48:07],But so he was hospitalized?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:08:48:10],[00:08:57:14],"No, I don't think he was. I think he was just taken care of right there in the camp. He made it through.",health;recreation
Martha Torrez,[00:08:57:16],[00:09:09:05],Were there any other Mexican American families living in Idaho when you first arrived? Do you remember anything about the Bracero program or undocumented workers?,mexico;idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:09:09:12],[00:09:35:10],"I remember when they first started to come. As far as other Hispanics being here when we first arrived, I can't recall ever seeing any. I do know that shortly after we came, other Hispanics came to live where we lived in Marsing.",marsing
Abel Vasquez,[00:09:35:12],[00:09:50:28],"And I do remember the Braceros, when they used to come here to work in the fields. One of the things that really used to amaze me about those poor people was that they'd work out in the fields like we used to in the wintertime, topping beets, like I was telling you about earlier.",
Abel Vasquez,[00:09:51:01],[00:09:59:21],"And they'd wear whatever they had, and, mind you, it was a hard life for them at the time.",
Martha Torrez,[00:09:59:26],[00:10:07:04],"What else do you remember from that era about these people who were coming in, like the Braceros?",
Abel Vasquez,[00:10:07:08],[00:10:36:22],"The workers, when they first came here, would put up with almost anything to make money to send back to their families in Mexico. They would live in little houses bunched together, shacks all put together.",mexico
Abel Vasquez,[00:10:36:25],[00:11:07:14],"I do remember when we were living in Marsing in 1940–41, my grandmother used to take in boarders and cook for them. We used to have a little shack in the back, but we lived in a tent, and these people would come to work in the fields. My grandmother made extra money by giving them room and board, and she had to cook for them.",marsing;family
Abel Vasquez,[00:11:07:14],[00:11:32:24],"Sometimes there were maybe 12 to 15 people she would board, and she charged them about a dollar to a dollar and a half a day for room and board. She was doing all the cooking for those people on an old wood stove, I'm sure you've seen them. That's how she cooked for all those people.",
Martha Torrez,[00:11:32:26],[00:11:41:18],You mentioned these people put up with whatever they had to in order to keep working. Do you remember any kind of differential treatment they had to endure?,health
Abel Vasquez,[00:11:49:05],[00:12:09:17],"Well, I can't really say. I don't know if they were treated any differently. At my age, I thought that was just the way it was supposed to be, I thought it was normal. So it's really difficult for me to say they weren't treated fairly, because I didn't know any better.",
Martha Torrez,[00:12:09:18],[00:12:11:11],Do you recall any specific situation?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:12:11:17],[00:12:31:26],"No, I don't recall a farmer ever mistreating them or discriminating against them. I cannot recall that. I know they worked hard.",
Martha Torrez,[00:12:31:28],[00:12:36:10],"So it sounds like, compared to white workers, they did the same work.",
Abel Vasquez,[00:12:36:12],[00:12:54:25],"Oh, no, neither did we, really. If we didn't have proper clothing for the conditions, that was our problem. Nobody supplied us with anything.",clothing
Martha Torrez,[00:12:54:27],[00:13:02:10],Was that difficult? Do you remember them having to go out and work without proper clothing?,clothing
Abel Vasquez,[00:13:02:10],[00:13:29:21],"Again, sometimes we think ignorance is bliss. When you don't know there's something better, you do the best you can with what you have. I'm sure my grandmother and grandfather worried whether we were adequately dressed to do the job, but we didn't know any better.",family
Martha Torrez,[00:13:29:23],[00:13:46:08],"And you weren't around any other way of living, so that was normal for you: as long as you had a place to be warm and something to eat.",
Abel Vasquez,[00:13:46:10],[00:14:00:21],"So anyway, that's what I remember about growing up as a little Mexican boy here in Marsing.",mexico;marsing
Martha Torrez,[00:14:00:24],[00:14:08:00],"When you worked in the fields, do you remember anything about wages, what you were paid?",
Abel Vasquez,[00:14:08:02],[00:14:41:19],"Well, we always worked piecework, we never got paid by the hour. My grandfather always taught us, 'You're going to get paid for what you do, the more you do, the more you make.' We never worked by the hour. All piecework. I remember topping beets for six or seven dollars an acre.",family
Abel Vasquez,[00:14:41:22],[00:15:14:19],"I remember popping beets by the ton, I can't recall how much per ton, but we used to haul the tops by hand onto a truck. Sometimes the fields were so muddy we had to hitch a team of horses to the truck to pull it out because the weather was so bad. Those little things stick in my mind because they don't happen anymore.",
Martha Torrez,[00:15:14:26],[00:15:17:15],So work was basically just a lot harder than it is today?,
Abel Vasquez,[00:15:17:17],[00:15:19:03],"Oh yes, right.",
Martha Torrez,[00:15:19:10],[00:15:23:07],"I mean, you were only like ten or twelve years old.",
Abel Vasquez,[00:15:23:07],[00:15:48:27],"And I have a grandson who's having a birthday today, he's nine years old. I sit down sometimes, didn't tell him, but I think: at eight years old, I was outside in cold weather, working alongside my grandpa topping beets. And today, we don't even think about it.",health
Abel Vasquez,[00:15:48:29],[00:15:52:05],Yeah,
Martha Torrez,[00:15:52:08],[00:15:57:09],"Right. Now on the subject of education, you did attend school in Marsing. Describe your earliest memory of school.",education;marsing
Abel Vasquez,[00:16:19:08],[00:16:46:29],"I started school in Grand Junction, Colorado, in first and second grade. We lived in a place called La Colonia, next to a sugar beet factory, the railroad tracks, and the river, a typical place where they put all the Hispanics.",education;labor;railroads and transportation
Abel Vasquez,[00:16:47:01],[00:17:24:10],"I think even today we sometimes segregate ourselves, not because Anglo people separate us, but because we do it ourselves. Anyway, I remember walking to school barefoot, we didn't have money sometimes. I started school in Grand Junction up to second grade, and I started third grade in Marsing.",recreation;education;marsing
Martha Torrez,[00:17:24:13],[00:17:30:25],Was there a difference? Did the school system feel different from Colorado to Idaho?,education;idaho
Abel Vasquez,[00:17:30:27],[00:17:53:04],"No, I don't think it was that different. At that time, school was about learning to read, write, and do arithmetic, the 'three R's.' That was most important. We didn't have all the extras we have today, but I didn't notice a real difference. In Colorado or Idaho, you learned to read, write, and do arithmetic.",education;idaho
Martha Torrez,[00:18:09:06],[00:18:32:12],"Right, school must have been nice for you. I know from my own experience that sometimes where I was raised, it was so cold I didn't have enough to keep me warm. You were one of many children, so going to school, a warm room, new pencils, Crayolas, a well-groomed teacher with polish and lipstick, was a whole new world you didn't have at home.",education;health
Abel Vasquez,[00:18:54:10],[00:18:55:20],"Oh yes, right.",
Martha Torrez,[00:18:55:23],[00:19:07:09],"Because of your living conditions, school was like an escape, something nice and orderly.",education
Abel Vasquez,[00:19:07:13],[00:19:08:06],Well-groomed.,
Martha Torrez,[00:19:08:06],[00:19:26:07],"Teachers like that, our mothers weren't glamorous; they were busy raising children, and our fathers were out in the fields. So school was a completely different world.",education
Abel Vasquez,[00:19:26:13],[00:19:28:10],It's a completely different world.,
Martha Torrez,[00:19:28:13],[00:19:34:01],Do you recall any other Hispanic children in your class when you came in third grade?,education
Abel Vasquez,[00:19:34:04],[00:19:45:20],"I was the only one, well, me and my sister were the only ones in Marsing until 1940. We were the only Hispanics.",family;marsing
Martha Torrez,[00:19:45:20],[00:19:46:28],Probably one of the very first.,
Abel Vasquez,[00:19:46:28],[00:19:50:13],"First, right.",
Martha Torrez,[00:19:50:15],[00:19:51:20],First year in this area.,
Abel Vasquez,[00:19:51:21],[00:20:08:24],"Right, the first Hispanics I can remember. Then in 1940, some other people came from Grand Junction, and I remember them coming to live in Marsing. So it was just me and my sister who were the first Hispanics.",marsing;family
Martha Torrez,[00:20:08:27],[00:20:12:18],Came here to set up to ah...,
Abel Vasquez,[00:20:12:21],[00:20:17:20],"Maravilla, yeah they were there.",
Martha Torrez,[00:20:17:23],[00:20:21:01],How do you recall being in school as far as grades?,education
Abel Vasquez,[00:20:21:03],[00:20:56:07],"I was just an average student. My parents didn't put much emphasis on education, they figured they'd rather have a good worker than a good scholar. But we did fairly well. I never flunked a grade. The ironic thing is, we used to start school late, like in November, and only go about six months a year because we had to quit early to work in the fields and start late because harvest was still going.",education;labor;agriculture
Abel Vasquez,[00:20:56:07],[00:21:25:04],"So my teachers took extra time with me, helping me catch up. And the other kids, the Anglo kids, also helped me. All the teachers were really nice to me and my sister, and the students were very helpful.",family
Martha Torrez,[00:22:14:12],[00:22:21:20],"You started in November, it sounded like it was just you. Was that the norm for migrant families?",migration
Abel Vasquez,[00:22:21:20],[00:22:44:28],"School was always September to whenever, but we had to quit and start late because September and October had the best working weather. When it got cold, we went to school all winter. Then in spring, when it warmed up, our parents pulled us out to work. That's why I never flunked, I must have had good teachers who worked hard to help me catch up.",education;health
Martha Torrez,[00:23:06:16],[00:23:25:17],"He was a bright boy, from what I can see. Even when I met him before we got married, I saw so much potential. He's a born mathematician. After we married, he told me that as a little boy, the older men, who couldn't read or write, would single him out to figure out their acreage and pay. He had to be a smart kid to do that.",
Martha Torrez,[00:23:48:11],[00:23:51:27],"So your experience was shaped by the harvest, you had to leave school early.",agriculture;education
Abel Vasquez,[00:23:51:29],[00:23:52:13],You know.,
Martha Torrez,[00:23:52:15],[00:24:02:06],"It doesn't sound like you had to move to new cities or states often, so you didn't change schools much.",
Abel Vasquez,[00:24:02:06],[00:24:04:21],I remember the only time I changed schools was when we came to Nampa. I started seventh grade there in 1943.,nampa;education
Martha Torrez,[00:24:20:05],[00:24:27:01],What do you remember about being a Mexican-American student in school?,education
Abel Vasquez,[00:24:27:03],[00:24:31:22],"Being the only one, I didn't think it was any different. I played with the Anglo kids, we fit right in. I never felt out of place.",

Abel Vasquez,[00:24:56:05],[00:25:22:15],"Actually, we spoke more English at home because my grandmother was fluent in English. My step-grandfather didn't understand English, so we used Spanish for his benefit. But no, I don't recall it being a problem.",family
Martha Torrez,[00:25:22:19],[00:25:40:15],It was more English-speaking than Spanish. It wasn't until we got married that we spoke more Spanish. I could see he was comfortable in both languages.,
Abel Vasquez,[00:25:40:17],[00:26:09:15],"By 1943, more Hispanics were here. In fact, a family from Grand Junction came to Marsing around 1940 or '41, my grandmother knew them. They're still here, dear friends. They later moved to Nampa.",family;marsing;nampa
Martha Torrez,[00:26:25:13],[00:26:27:12],And that's when you started seeing more of them?,

Abel Vasquez,[00:26:39:27],[00:27:06:25],"Yes, one. In third grade, I think I had a crush on her. Mrs. Gilmore, my teacher in Marsing. She went the extra mile to help me. She knew I needed more help than the other kids.",education;marsing
Abel Vasquez,[00:27:06:25],[00:27:21:23],She would take me by the hand and help me. That's what teaching was to me. I'm sure she knew I'd missed school and needed to catch up.,education
Martha Torrez,[00:27:55:20],[00:27:59:00],Tell her about when you wanted to play ball but couldn't.,
Abel Vasquez,[00:27:59:02],[00:28:25:29],"That was in junior high, seventh grade. I wanted to go out for basketball. They said, 'Everybody who wants to play, come on down.' I was one of the first.",education
Abel Vasquez,[00:28:25:29],[00:28:52:00],"But to play, you had to furnish your own sneakers. I didn't have any, but I played barefoot the first day. The second day, I got blisters on the hardwood floor. My folks couldn't afford sneakers, so I didn't participate in basketball.",clothing;timber

Abel Vasquez,[00:30:04:11],[00:30:27:12],"I think I was trying to relive my childhood through my kids. I really wanted to play basketball, but I didn't want to burden my folks, they could barely make ends meet. So I said I didn't want to play anymore. I never participated in sports because you had to stay after school to practice, and that was when we worked in the fields.",recreation;education
Abel Vasquez,[00:30:57:04],[00:31:21:27],"Being a field worker, you had to work when crops were ready, the crops didn't wait for you. As the older male in the family, I was next in line to help support us. I liked school, but by 14, it became a hassle. There were social pressures, clubs, nice clothes, and I felt inadequate because I wasn't dressed properly.",labor;family;education
Martha Torrez,[00:32:26:20],[00:32:31:19],You felt out of place.,
Abel Vasquez,[00:32:34:28],[00:32:58:19],"I felt out of place, not because I thought I wasn't adequate, but because I didn't have nice jeans, shoes, or shirts like the other kids. I knew something was wrong, but the kids didn't make me feel that way. I was my own worst critic. At 14, in ninth grade, I quit school.",clothing;education
Martha Torrez,[00:33:28:14],[00:33:48:02],"Did you feel resentment? Did you blame anyone for not fitting in, because of peer pressure and not having what others had?",
Abel Vasquez,[00:33:48:04],[00:34:19:18],I didn't have resentment. I don't think the kids cared how I looked. I was my own worst critic. Some of those kids are still friends of mine today.,
Martha Torrez,[00:34:26:21],[00:34:32:08],So he just didn't want to humiliate himself internally.,
Abel Vasquez,[00:34:32:10],[00:35:06:14],"I told my grandmother, 'I don't want to go to school anymore.' She asked why, but I just didn't want to. I was 14.
