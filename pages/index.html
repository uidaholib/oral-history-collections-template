<p>Latah County was an exhilarating place to live at the beginning of the twentieth century. Residents of the county contended with <a href="#animals" >wild animals</a>, <a href="#lynching" >mob actions</a>, <a href="#Great Depression" >economic upheaval</a>, <a href="#murder" >revenge murders</a>, <a href="#iww" >union struggles</a>, <a href="#accidents" >mining and logging accidents</a>, and various other challenges in settling and inhabiting an area that had already long been inhabited by many <a href="#Native Americans" >Native Americans</a> who called the place home.</p>
