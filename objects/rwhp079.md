00;01;43;02 - Doris Burns Carlson: would you say that you, lived in Windsor? first, how did you get there?

00;01;51;00 - Unknown Interviewer: that was quite an interesting story, too. we came from North Dakota to Billings, and we was only there one year, and then I went into nurse's training. I graduated from high school in Billings. Then I went to nurses training. The Deaconess Hospital in Billings, and my sister and brother came to Idaho to visit. And then my folks came.

00;02;08;11 - Unknown Interviewer: And that was a real interesting story of my folks coming to visit, because when they left, they had an old car with a trailer behind them and, all the way up. They said that it was so surprising because everybody would honk and holler and laugh at them, and they got suspicious and took out about halfway my dad to, I'm going to go look, I think there's something funny with our trailer.

00;02;32;03 - Unknown Interviewer: He went out and looked behind, and just before they left, I slipped out and just married all over the back of their trailer. And so then they realized. So I got the first letter back from Idaho. I think you can imagine.

00;02;46;13 - Doris Burns Carlson: But how old were you?

00;02;48;01 - Unknown Interviewer: I was about 19 at that time, and they would had been married 30 years. And they were they weren't suspicious at all. Yeah. So we both we was quite the gang could play tricks on one another. So.

00;03;02;09 - Doris Burns Carlson: Well. And you came from North Dakota.

00;03;04;05 - Unknown Interviewer: Was that right? Yeah. When I was 18. And then I was in Billings about two years. Three years. And then I came to Weezer and I worked in Weezer maybe five years in a small hospital there. And then I went to Chicago for two years, and then I came to Idaho. My brother had married a girl up here, and we came.

00;03;23;16 - Unknown Interviewer: We moved to Moscow Square. We first met in Mountain Moscow. Then I met my husband there. And then, of course, I lived in Troy ever since.

00;03;30;23 - Doris Burns Carlson: Okay. okay, let's get into your family background before we go on. what was your mother's maiden name?

00;03;41;18 - Unknown Interviewer: Bessie. Alice Richter. Bessie.

00;03;47;18 - Unknown Interviewer: And she was a pioneer of Idaho. I mean, I'm North Dakota.

00;03;51;16 - Doris Burns Carlson: I'm North Dakota. And, what was her occupation?

00;03;58;14 - Unknown Interviewer: my mother didn't get any education when she was about in a third or fourth grade. She was the oldest of seven children, and her mother was sickly. So she stayed home. When she was 21, her father bought her a piano and gave her piano lessons. And my mother, not even when she came to Idaho, she used to do this.

00;04;16;02 - Unknown Interviewer: She used to go into homes and take care of babies when they were born. They didn't go to hospitals, and she used to do that and lots of times free of charge. But when she got older, she used to give free piano lessons to people that had many children in there. They were musical. She'd give her free lessons many times.

00;04;32;01 - Unknown Interviewer: She did it in one family court. I think there were 6 or 7 children, and she just gave all of those children pianos, and sometime they come do a little work. But that's all she ever got paid for it.

00;04;41;10 - Doris Burns Carlson: She was she was, instructed in piano and, and was a midwife.

00;04;47;19 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah.

00;04;48;21 - Doris Burns Carlson: And what was your father. What did you father.

00;04;50;17 - Unknown Interviewer: My father was a blacksmith. And then he would we alternated between farming and blacksmithing. So we moved three years or so. Longest I ever remember living in a place until I got married. And, we've had I had many farming experience. Like I said, I was the one who wanted to be a boy. And in North Dakota, when he used to.

00;05;11;27 - Unknown Interviewer: Hey, I had to be the one on top of the stack, or I had to run the more or the buck rake. And we always lived quite a ways from school. We used to walk two and three miles to school, and when I went to high school, I started driving the car and I had one of my sons, and he gave me this car and told me to drive.

00;05;29;07 - Unknown Interviewer: It must have been five miles. I had to go to town and I drove until it got cold and I froze the radiator. Then I had to walk to meet the bus and that was a couple miles. So North Dakota has a lot of memories for me. And I did the same year when we moved away.

00;05;48;04 - Doris Burns Carlson: well, how many were in your family? There were.

00;05;50;07 - Unknown Interviewer: Four children. We had two children that had died after there was support for the three girls. And there was a boy two years after myself. But just a day when he got old enough to help, he had a ruptured appendix. And so he wasn't very well. And then when he got over that, then he went and worked out.

00;06;03;24 - Unknown Interviewer: And so I was the man around the house all my life.

00;06;06;20 - Doris Burns Carlson: And so he was out of the.

00;06;09;06 - Unknown Interviewer: Home, you know, then he go and work out by the people as soon as he got well over this ruptured appendix deal, and he never was back to cope anymore. Well, my father worked out quite a bit, and we had a small farm, and it was during the depression, and I can remember my mother and I was home alone and we had our choice be in North Dakota.

00;06;27;16 - Unknown Interviewer: They always had a big night on Saturday night for Mother's Day. But we have our choice. We either have to spend this money that we get from the cows and the chickens to buy food for them, or we can go out in the field because there wasn't very good standard for wheat. We can go out and cut the grain heads off and feed the chickens, and we'd spend that money, go to town Saturday night.

00;06;46;29 - Unknown Interviewer: So I did that. We heard the cattle. And then during those dust storms, I used to ride a horse and I would have to ride in a small meadow, and I have to ride constantly so that I could see the cattle. And I would take a book a long time. And before I could read one page, I had to brush or blow the dirt off the page book so I could finish reading.

00;07;05;22 - Unknown Interviewer: Was that strong? In the dirt? The rest I would take a second and a scissors. And over my back when I went out to herd the cattle, or put it on the horse and I go and cut off this wheat heads and take them home and feed the chickens so we could have our fun Saturday night.

00;07;23;27 - Doris Burns Carlson: Well, where did you live?

00;07;26;15 - Unknown Interviewer: That was on a porch. Let me drive into Carrington. About probably 15 miles. We have to go North Dakota. That was in North Dakota.

00;07;33;03 - Doris Burns Carlson: It hurt. And, did you, How do you.

00;07;44;27 - Unknown Interviewer: I had lots of fun in North Dakota. This old car we used to drive, we never had a flat tire. And every time my dad would come home on the weekend, he'd have 2 or 3 flat and never last us all through the week, and we'd go anywhere we wanted to go. No brakes. My mother would drive the car.

00;07;58;25 - Unknown Interviewer: I wasn't trying to think I was all that, and she'd turn off the key and I'd shift the gears for her, and then she'd take her foot off the brake and they would stop. And we really had fun. We really enjoyed that. That year.

00;08;14;06 - Doris Burns Carlson: so you were 19 when we moved out here.

00;08;16;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Did you live like this? I was 18 when we came to Billings and I was nine. Yeah, I'm about 19 when my folks moved to Windsor to visit.

00;08;23;15 - Doris Burns Carlson: I mean, how long did you stay in with you?

00;08;25;28 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, I must have been there about five years. We had a farm up here, too.

00;15;04;21 - Unknown Interviewer: So I wanted to have a place where I could rest. So the whole first year when we moved in, we climbed to a ladder through the main to this main place here.

And then one of the master's kids got sick, and then I went back from that, get it home. And then I went to work for the university. I got this job at university.

00;17;18;27 - Unknown Interviewer: I came out here to then I've just been helping here on the farm and the work, and we kind of do our cattle ourselves. You raise a lot of bees from seed and get our own grafting and our own putting. In fact, we've done many things that the people in this area say it's not possible. You know, take two limbs of apples and you wrap it together and they'll make a tie.

00;17;37;11 - Unknown Interviewer: You can just walk right up the center of some of the trees. My son keeps cutting a lot. I don't like him, but that's what we get him.

00;17;47;10 - Doris Burns Carlson: do you feel like that you have more free time now than you did when you were younger? Or. Oh.

00;17;54;15 - Unknown Interviewer: I don't know what you mean by fruit. Yeah, I've always been busy doing something. I don't know, I feel kind of pressure because here we've help with the farm, and then we're here at the car lot. So I think my time is pretty well spent. I mean, I don't have too much time that I can just say, well, okay, I'm just going to take off and do what I want.

00;18;18;26 - Doris Burns Carlson: if you had a choice of,

00;18;31;04 - Doris Burns Carlson: Did you have you ever thought of what would happen if something happened to your husband? What you do?

00;18;35;27 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't run. Carlos, but, Oh, I think I'm old enough now. I'm getting awfully close to retirement, and I've had a lot of hobbies. I just kind of keep on with my hobbies. I think, I don't think I really go out and look for work. I'm not too sure of that. If I did, I probably would maybe go in for.

00;19;00;09 - Unknown Interviewer: There is, a group that goes out and talks to the, you know, the blind or the deaf where they go and contact people like that. I wouldn't mind doing something like that public service or something and or maybe even into a restaurant. I could come do something like that. I don't know, I used to think about it because I thought, well, I could go back into nursing, but, anymore, I think maybe.

00;19;29;15 - Doris Burns Carlson: so it seems like that we went over the first part of your life pretty fast. Is there anything that you would like to add about? how it was to get through the depression or.

00;19;42;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, the depression. That's where I was saying that we cut off these heads and I was riding the cattle around, you know, to keep them. Yeah. Grazing. And because all this family was working so myself, I was home with my mother and we had to everything there had to be done there on the farm. We didn't do any farming that year because of the divorce.

00;20;01;08 - Unknown Interviewer: We just decided it wasn't worth it. So they all went to work and we just, volunteered. Just what? We cut off a beat and we just. Yeah, I just turned the cattle and we just had chickens. Cows, and, I can remember going to school and all the kids were hand-me-down dresses. There was no fancy clothes. And then my older sisters graduated from high school.

00;20;24;15 - Unknown Interviewer: But each one, the girls made their own dresses. They were all homemade dress year at the graduation. And, and I remember going that and that school where we was, they burned down and they built a new school. And when they built the new school, they put in a gym. They've never had basketball there before. And I was still in the seventh and eighth grade when this came in.

00;20;48;08 - Unknown Interviewer: And I remember they came out really short. My dad, no girls and I and I remember going to wear those shorts and not going to play basketball. So the girls, I never even turned out. But when I came out, I turned up and I got on the team and I played on the team for four years, and they didn't say a thing.

00;21;03;24 - Unknown Interviewer: In fact, he was proud of it. So. But I always learned how to work my foot. I you never I never learned to fuck up. You know, I would just let things go and let things come on kind of gradually and I didn't have a problem. I didn't come right out and ask either. Go see.

00;21;20;09 - Doris Burns Carlson: Okay.

00;21;20;26 - Unknown Interviewer: So I kind of worked that one little bit on the old man. But anyway, it was real fun. And the old school busses we used to drive wasn't these fancy models like you have now? It was just an old truck and they put it all wooden back on, and then had wooden seats on both sides, and I started buckling down through the middle.

00;21;37;15 - Unknown Interviewer: And that's what they had for school busses, and we used to ride them at then I, we, my house, my folks was too far out and they imported the school teacher there, and her folks lived close. And so then I stayed in her home. So we just traded places, and I went in their school bus and rode with their kids, 5 pound.

00;22;01;02 - Unknown Interviewer: And some mother kept a schoolteacher quite a few years that way. Yeah, we we only lived a couple years out there, though. Then we moved to another place. I, I this year I want to go back and kind of look up some of those old places. They're having a reunion back at that school, and I want to go back and see if I can find some of these old friends.

00;22;22;21 - Unknown Interviewer: My.

00;22;37;20 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh.

00;22;42;18 - Doris Burns Carlson: Oh, yeah. Well, could you, talk a little about how you've seen. You've lived here for 35 years. Is that right now?

00;22;52;00 - Unknown Interviewer: I'm 30 to 35, and I'd hope.

00;22;55;04 - Doris Burns Carlson: Most of it in Troy. Yeah. Okay. So, can you tell us something about some way how, Troy has changed in those 35 years?

00;23;06;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Over the last couple years, it's kind of truly has grown. It was kind of a small place before, and, but now they're just really spread. Not all over, you know, there's new houses in practically every area. And, ourselves, we can we notice it more than we did before because we have a plane and an airstrip right down the middle of the orchard we have out there.

00;23;30;06 - Unknown Interviewer: And when you get up and you can fly around, you can see the whole trailer house. Some things moved up there before, and a lot of people put in ponds. There's a lot of ponds, you know, that wasn't before. So I think that has changed our climate. I think that's made it warmer. We get more rain and snow.

00;23;44;14 - Unknown Interviewer: there are usually when they ask about our water shed, they always give us the Moscow and we put in we have five ponds on the place and my husband put it on himself. And of course I helped him. I used to run the roller and and, yeah, he runs the bulldozer and pushes it. And then you have a roller with tape on it to pack it.

00;24;05;00 - Unknown Interviewer: And I have done that a couple of times. When you've made contract. In fact, like I said, we have the Five ponds and we put this big pond in, they come and set the road and take two years to fill it. And it was know way before Christmas because, you see, we live close to the mountain on that side mountain where the snow comes down and we get about twice the rain profit during Moscow.

00;24;25;00 - Unknown Interviewer: We don't bring back until we fill that ponds so fast we can put it in a great big pond and we get, like I said, buy twice the Moscow gate. It's now two and it's only all the water we get in our pond is from rain and snow drainage from the hill and we put in a whole orchard.

00;24;42;02 - Unknown Interviewer: We have six acres of water that we planted, so there was maybe a small cherry orchard and two different spots and a few apples. When we got married, we tore down all the outbuildings like the barn and the chicken house and or we've had some very harassing experiences on that farm, and we was there, we moved the garage across and we just bring some, or some blames and stuff.

00;25;07;08 - Unknown Interviewer: And my husband pulled the square I dragged across there and set it over where we wanted to have it. And the oldest little boy was just about two years old, he said. Looked at it. Pretty far left in the garage was up. There was a pretty fire on it. Loved it. Burned out the side of the garage and, then we're done for.

00;25;26;04 - Unknown Interviewer: One pond is now. There was some big trees we were going to take out. And so one morning when the kids were in bed, we went out and put dynamite under these trees and then, cut them off until they were fairly good sized stumps. And so we put them out and rose from behind the garage, you know, is when the dynamite was going to go up.

00;25;46;14 - Unknown Interviewer: And here that big stump came up and it came right down through the roof of the garage. There.

00;25;51;29 - Doris Burns Carlson: And this is on your farm.

00;25;54;26 - Unknown Interviewer: On the farm up there and there. We couldn't watch it, and it could have come right down through the bedroom just as easy. I for the kids, for sleeping. And another thing we did that everybody thought my my sister said, I'm going to write a book sometime about the crazy neighbors, and it's going to be about us. But, he was quite an inventor.

00;26;13;07 - Unknown Interviewer: We dug our basement with dynamite under the house where the house was standing on one. he started to get hold of German. Sadness is heavy. Quite. You know what you can't get into? So he just. He made a drill and he built so many holes and put dynamite in. But he got smarter. He'd drill more holes and put them in.

00;26;31;20 - Unknown Interviewer: And he had just about cleared out when one time the first one went off before he got out and he didn't think it was going to make it out. And he had broken ribs. And I remember this quiet come out. We got we made it. We only broke one dish and that whole thing and shake in the house.

00;26;50;06 - Unknown Interviewer: So, so.

00;26;52;06 - Doris Burns Carlson: really kind of contributed a lot. You, in being kind of a carpenter and a gardener and a farmer or a nurse and, you had quite a very background.

00;27;04;11 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, very. And another thing that I think, too, that we hadn't quite done this was it is when the doctor came, he was the one that brought the scheme. And, the very first year he came, he put a ski toe up on the hill right above our house. And that's where we all learned to ski. All the children.

00;27;20;12 - Unknown Interviewer: How old were you? I had half of the children at that time. The youngest boy was about two. And, he was, and my husband could ski straight, but he couldn't turn. He didn't know how to turn. And this little boy, he would he wouldn't stay in the house. And he couldn't be, of course. And he'd stand out there and scream.

00;27;37;25 - Unknown Interviewer: My husband came around his neck and he was learning to ski himself. And he'd go down. He'd fall down the little of the road. I mean, he didn't care. He'd never cry at all unless we met him at the bottom of the hill. And so he learned to ski around his father's neck, and. But he was four. We had to buy him ski boots and skis, and he'd stand down there or somebody help him up, let it ski the hill.

00;27;55;01 - Unknown Interviewer: He's always skiing. He's really a skier that, that we put in. We've had about four different locations out there where we put ski toes out. And one year and one place we broke five legs. The fun day.

00;28;11;01 - Doris Burns Carlson: It's. I think five.

00;28;12;11 - Unknown Interviewer: People think.

00;28;13;12 - Doris Burns Carlson: People ski him and. So we've kind of had a, a ski resort too,

00;28;23;15 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Have we charged one year? We put it on a kind of intermediate hill, and it was a real good hill, and it wasn't very good for beginners. And we had people come from all over. It was a real good snow a year, and it was a good deal. We had a lot of people there, and that year we didn't have too much problem.

00;28;40;02 - Unknown Interviewer: But a lot of these old timers around here, in fact, we had a couple bachelors out here that, learned to ski in their 40s and they went all over ski and then after that. But now they're getting into all here skiing now. But, yeah, we had all the kids learning to ski, and it was fun. We really enjoyed it.

00;28;56;16 - Doris Burns Carlson: Have you, have you ski recently?

00;28;59;01 - Unknown Interviewer: two years ago, when my daughter was an instructor at Moscow. Up here to the one on the mountain here camera. She insisted I had to go up and take lessons, so I got. So now I can turn and I could take the toe, but I, still, I'm very cautious. I don't, I, I'm kind of slow.

00;29;14;13 - Doris Burns Carlson: I think you I think you have a break breaker.

00;29;20;08 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, I because I get pushed along. She was going to take me and right here I wouldn't have driven up the hill. But we took our Scott went up the hill every, every Sunday.

00;29;34;00 - Doris Burns Carlson: Well, you talk a lot about your, trouble. what do you see as their future? is is it going to be better than ours or.

00;29;48;27 - Unknown Interviewer: I really believe we're headed in for, the difficult times. I really believe we're going to have labor problems. The unemployment rate. And I think unions came in with a real good idea, and I think they were very necessary. But I think now that they've got too much power and I believe that, they're demanding too high wages and, and too much that that big employers can't cope with it.

00;30;19;27 - Unknown Interviewer: And I think we're headed for difficulties between the capital and labor.

00;30;25;23 - Doris Burns Carlson: And I do think, this will affect your life.

00;30;30;18 - Unknown Interviewer: I think it'll affect everybody, anywhere, but not as much here in the local countries. It will be in towns and cities. I think it's going to be really kind of rough, you know, with, with the, the inflation and everything. I believe we're headed for rough times. So I think we're in a ideal situation right here.

00;30;45;23 - Doris Burns Carlson: What do you mean?

00;30;51;23 - Doris Burns Carlson: What, how do how do you think the roles have changed for, women? as while you were growing up. And now do you think they've changed?

00;31;05;18 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, yes. I think women get into more politics, and I think they get into more businesses. And I think it. Well, I really think the woman has always actually and boss in her way if she was a smart woman. But I think now she doesn't have to show that smart. She just goes ahead and more as a dictator.

00;31;25;10 - Unknown Interviewer: I really think she's maybe overstepped her line. I think it was better when the woman. And she. No, no, he was the first doctor. And our youngest son was the first baby he he delivered. He came in the fall and he was born in February and I knew he was coming. So I did go to end up coming back here.

00;31;46;16 - Unknown Interviewer: So he was the first one. And then they had a girl sometime just, oh, maybe a week later than ours. And that that was the first two babies here.

00;31;55;27 - Doris Burns Carlson: And, so you had a doctor, who for your children?

00;32;01;10 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, we went to Moscow for all that. They were all born the Moscow hospital. And, But then doctor came, and then I had him,

00;32;13;02 - Doris Burns Carlson: Well, how do you think,

00;32;18;20 - Doris Burns Carlson: Did you, plan to have three children?

00;32;21;27 - Unknown Interviewer: I plan to have six and then six, but, and that after having that many, I didn't carry them that easy. And I had problems, but not not that I would chance of losing them, but I just got to our foundation. I couldn't have to get around and I couldn't. We got. So I just decided Craig was my limit.

00;32;44;02 - Doris Burns Carlson: well, I had,

00;32;46;15 - Unknown Interviewer: We planned for all hours. Everyone of was. We wanted them all.

00;32;50;19 - Doris Burns Carlson: Well, where did, your knowledge of, childbirth and childbearing come from? Did was your mother important in that part or.

00;32;59;29 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, yeah. And oh I always liked kids and then of course went to nurses training and I didn't mind taking care of the children. I enjoyed children but then I read quite a few books on it and, but you know, you don't read as much as when you get older. And now if I were younger, I think I would know more, but I wouldn't I wouldn't want to go back for another.

00;33;26;26 - Doris Burns Carlson: I yeah. You're saying that, childbearing you've gotten, more things. I've known about it now.

00;33;32;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, I think so. But I think they have more problems now too.

00;33;36;03 - Doris Burns Carlson: You, Can you think of things? Why would be that way?

00;33;40;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, there's too many kids around, and some kids don't have to work. And if you want your kids to work, which I think is a blessing to all kids, I think we have. Yeah.
