    "description": "The United States has been around for more than 250 years, and the mechanisms for the way people vote has changed as the US matures. Many people wonder what voting can look like in the future. Voting on an app? Voting being done without paper? A national holiday for the presidential election? This panel will discuss path towards new voting means, and the issues preventing them. This program is funded by the 'Why It Matters: Civic and Electoral Participation' initiative, administered by the Federation of State Humanities Councils and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.",
