If you're not familiar with our organization, I encourage you to check out our website, Idaho humanities.org. And I'd also like to remind you that you may submit any questions using the Q&A feature or the chat located at the bottom of your screen.",
Doug Exton,[00:00:23:16],00:00:31:05,And with me today is Frank de la Teja and it's an honor to have you with us today. And I turn it over to you to talk about the Alamo.,
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:00:31:07],00:00:58:14,"All right. Well, good afternoon. And, I, was just, wondering with Doug about, why, choosing the Alamo as a topic, but I guess, perhaps, some of you, or many of you are aware that, a book that, recently came out and in fact, I think it came out after I was asked, to, do this presentation, about the Alamo.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:00:58:14],00:01:25:18,"It's called Forget the Alamo was done by three reporters, here. Who in Texas? Who, Decided to take a rather, jaundiced view of, what the Alamo might mean. And, and so the the Alamo has once again, and I mean, once again, because over the years, it's happened numerous times. But that would be, the subject of another talk, not this one.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:01:25:20],00:02:02:00,"But the Alamo has become embroiled in a number of, what we what we have come to call these days, culture wars. And so it's, it's kind of fitting because, here in Texas, in fact, the revision of how we, address historical topics, particularly those having to do with the Texas Revolution and, of course, the Alamo is, this the the central, event, more so than the actual victory that led to independence, at San Jacinto.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:02:02:02],00:02:33:21,"A month later, or a little bit more than a month later. But these, these issues, have been also caught up in, what is now referred to by, by the acronym CRT, CRT, the, critical race theory, issue. And so in Texas, in the which is, has a legislature and a state government, entirely controlled, by Republicans.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:02:33:23],00:03:19:20,"It has, these issues have also become embroiled in kind of a national discussion about, how, the, teaching of history, in American history in particular, are caught up with the issues of social justice and, economic, and racial, equality. And so CRT in particular, critical race theory, which is, has been the target of a legislation that is now being, addressed in the special session of the legislature, in an effort to, prevent, the teaching of CRT.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:03:19:22],00:03:46:21,"And, that in itself is problematic since CRT is more of a theory than an actual curriculum or anything else. So it's very controversial. And the other side of it is, of course, that, because there has been critique of, the, Texas Revolution and particularly revolutionary heroes, such as, Bill Travis and Jim Bowie and so forth.",education;conflict;history
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:03:46:23],00:04:21:16,"During the regular session of the legislature, which just ended, there was, bill passed, that, to kind of I don't know if it was to mock, or as a counterweight, to the 1619 project, that The New York Times has, put forth as a way to do new curriculum and, that, these the, legislature passed a bill called the 1836 project.",education
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:04:21:18],00:04:53:22,"The effort there, being to, promote the teaching of a, kind of a heroic version of, Texas, revolution. So, my point being that, here in Texas, we're in the middle of, addressing these issues, they have become embroiled in the more general, issues of, of social justice, and racial equality and all of these at the national scope.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:04:53:24],00:05:23:24,"And, they have therefore become very politicized. Those of us who are working historians who are not, and who deal with that period of time, who, would much rather just say, here's the history, that, as we understand it and as we're trying to interpret it to the, well, I don't know about, are you, as anybody else having trouble?",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:05:23:24],00:06:14:04,"There's somebody who came up, said they were having trouble with the audio. Not, I don't know that I'm having trouble with the audio. Okay, so. And it's probably on the receiving end rather than the sending in. And so, the, the, the point being that, those of us historians working on the, topic are in fact interested in, broadening the way that we understand the Texas Revolution, and, and not teaching it in the same way that it was taught, 50,60, 70 years ago, because, teaching it that way, becomes less and less relevant to the increasingly diverse population of, of Texas.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:06:14:04],00:06:45:12,"We have, soon Texas will be, a majority Hispanic state. And yet, they were largely written out of the Texas Revolution for a very long time. African Americans continue to be an important, demographic here in the state. In their role in Texas history, remained minimized for a very long period of time. So, the point is that we, we need to be able to explain history.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:06:45:16],00:07:07:14,"We're not inventing anything. But we're bringing, parts of the history that hadn't been left out of what was taught and what was explained to the general public. We're trying to bring it back in, into the story. And I think it makes for a richer, story, as I hope that you'll understand as, as we, as I go through my presentation.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:07:07:19],00:07:37:05,"So what I'm going to, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to, turn on a PowerPoint presentation, that will allow those of you who, are interested in, the pictures rather than me, to stay with me.

Affiant remained an orphan and entirely destitute. At about the age of 15 years, he joined a train of American carts and arrived at Nacogdoches in the latter part of the year 1835, sometime after finding himself out of occupation, he was accepted as a cart driver in a body of Texian troops raised and commanded as much as Affiant can make out by Captain Henry Peel.",migration;indigenous;conflict

Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:10:07:16],00:10:31:14,"It was at Harrisburg that Affiant became acquainted with some of the men belonging to the company of J. Seguin.

Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:10:55:03],00:11:25:21,"The scar of said wound is yet apparent. So who were the Tejanos who served under? Once again, Lopez, our intrepid teenager, was not born in Texas. He had not arrived until late 1835. He was, in fact, like most of the Texians who participated in the battle, a recent immigrant from the United States fighting more for an idea presented to him by his leaders than anything else.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:11:25:23],00:11:56:08,"He, like most of the Texians who fought to attend Jacinto, had no property in Texas. No sophisticated sense of the politics behind the revolt against Mexican rule, and certainly no concept of the repercussions of his actions. Lopez was a diagonal because, as he makes clear in his statement, despite his Louisiana birth and recent arrival, he felt more comfortable among men who were most like him in language, customs and appearance.",culture
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:11:56:10],00:12:12:13,The suppression or ignorance of his presence in the battle is part of the legacy of the revolution. That is the theme of my talk today.,
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:12:12:15],00:12:40:24,"Before diving into other issues, let's establish some definitions. Tejano is simply a term that historians have been using for about 30 years now, to refer to Texans whose ethnic and cultural heritage are linked to the country we now call Mexico. It is, after all, the equivalent of Texan in Spanish. Anybody from Texas, regardless of race or ethnicity, who travels to Mexico, is at the piano once you get there.",history;culture
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:12:41:01],00:13:18:13,"By the same token, the English term for someone from the United States who claimed Texas as home was not quite set in 1836, Texas was rarely used, but Texian and Texan were popular. Of course, the enslaved African-Americans brought to Texas by their owners were not considered Texans by the Anglo-Americans, and their status was not entirely settled as far as Mexican law was concerned, an issue that was to become one of the causes of the rebellion and to be and to play a part in the culture wars of today.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:13:18:15],00:13:59:16,"And existing native people of Texas further complicated the human landscape, of the province. Despite what Austin said about Texas being a howling wilderness when he arrived, indigenous groups could be found in all parts of the territory that would become Texas, which greatly contributed to the legacy of Mexican and Republic Texas. And if you're if you see on this slide, you'll note that, there are, the words la Pons and Comanches and then in smaller other groups are noted with their camps and areas all throughout the, the map that Stephen F Austin drew.",indigenous;history

Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:14:31:21],00:14:59:17,"I must define what is meant by Texas for the Texas of 1835 was not the Lone Star state of today. Texas, on the eve of its war of Independence, included only the area from north and east of the Medina and Nueces rivers all the way to the Sabine, where the treaty of 1819 had established a permanent boundary between Spanish and U.S. territory until 1848.",conflict;environment
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:14:59:19],00:15:37:05,"Today, South Texas below San Antonio and Corpus Christi belong to Coachella and Tamaulipas. Today's West Texas belonged to New Mexico and Chihuahua. The idea of Texas is extending to the Rio Grande, dated to the Louisiana Purchase. But that also is, another story for another day. What is important for us today is that in winning the Revolution, Texas was able to make a claim on the Rio Grande, a claim that was turned into reality with the US victory in the Mexican War of 1846 1848.",conflict

I mean, it's a it's a huge territory, which, the, final, boundaries of which were determined by the, the agreement that was part of the compromise of 1850. But again, that's that's another story. We're going to move on here to what was going on.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:16:24:05],00:16:53:21,"What this means is that the history of Texas in the 1820s and 1830s has direct relevance to the shape that the United States ultimately took to the presence of an indigenous Hispanic population in the region, whether Tejano, Nuevo Mexicano or California. Due to the growing sexual crisis that resulted in the Civil War, and to the love hate relationship that has characterized Mexican U.S affairs for almost 200 years now.",indigenous;conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:16:53:23],00:17:30:08,"In this story, the role of Tejanos has largely been marginalized, although central to the turn of events. And so it is something that I want to emphasize. True, there were not many Tainos, but small numbers does not necessarily mean small influence. The channels were instrumental in shaping Texas history, but as a decreasing proportion of the population throughout the 19th century, their role almost completely disappeared at the hands of triumphalist, Anglo American writers, particularly those who followed Frederick Jackson Turner.",
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:17:30:10],00:18:11:05,"The culture war of today in Texas over how the Texas Revolution is understood and the role that the institution of field slavery played in it are a direct result of how Texas and American historians generally chose to represent the development of Texas from the coming of Mexican independence to the end of the Civil War. We won't get into the latter event, but let me just say that it was a history that was written by white men for a white audience, and with the changing demographics of the state, which will soon be majority Hispanic, the traditional story faces a rocky future.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:18:11:07],00:18:42:20,"So let me explain. In 1821, there were approximately 3000 Tejanos and only a handful of Texians, although the population had been nearly twice as large in 1800. The onset of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810, which reached Texas, twice, devastated the province.

Second, they faced economic disaster. The Spanish government had been unable to pay the garrisons at San Antonio and La Bahia with any regularity, so that soldiers and their families were destitute, with obvious consequences for merchants, farmers and artisans who depended on military payrolls for their business and the soldiers services for protection.",conflict
Jesús F. “Frank” de la Teja,[00:20:25:19],00:20:57:14,"Third, without safe conditions or economic activity beyond the subsistence level, there was little chance of population growth, particularly on the part of people of means unwilling to take the risks involved in establishing themselves on a hostile Indian frontier.
