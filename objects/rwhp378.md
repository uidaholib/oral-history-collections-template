Then they found themselves involved in a lot of things.

00:13:18:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And that was the route. The main reason I started some up. So before I enjoyed it, except for just selling circumstances, I had to quit before ten years ago. So. So I told my husband at the time would watch the children, so I had to quit. But I started to figure when I moved I could come because I didn't know anything.

I was more towards being a nurse so that I could work in the market with the babies. And then I got my first time and had Mary and I very different lives for a year.

00:20:55:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And then I, got married two years later and they had the two boys. And then I got divorced. Five years ago. 3.5 years ago. And I remember you can go.

00:21:15:15 - Unknown Interviewer: Do my thing, you know. What were your expectations? Expectations before you got married? The first time?

00:21:26:25 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I? I was pregnant with my daughter, and my father insisted I couldn't keep my baby and work. I got married, so a friend of ours arranged a marriage. Just more for namesakes than anything that comes from I got married first time that I tried. We tried to make a go of it, but there was just no context at all in the.

00:21:49:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I like my hunting and my fishing. Hunting let me have my pride and throwing my target rifle in the house.

00:21:55:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So oh.

00:22:21:25 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Doctor can.

00:22:23:07 - Unknown Interviewer: What? Well, what did you expect out of your second marriage? What do you expect out of a marriage?

00:22:30:14 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I've never had the, confirmed, by the way you do things together. And when I was married the second time, we did for a while. But then for then became an alcoholic. And it was rough to rough on my children. And, we we started out, we used to go hunting together, and it got to the point. We went hunting.

00:22:57:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I stayed home, watch the children, and after several years of not getting to go, then, you know, we can't go together. Why we married is my attitude. You know, we and I changed lots of attitude towards what I like and don't like to be, be with my husband and bring home change. He didn't want me to go so.

00:23:25:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It was drinking. Mainly the gap between the two of us.

00:23:28:20 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Was it hard making that initial decision to get divorced, or did you just, And then, I mean, when she started that.

00:23:37:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Going, oh, I moved over for several years. I mean, here I'd be magnifying one day. I was divorcing my next term. Things would just change, you know? Well, I'll try it, you know, but, I really think I set it off on the kind at the club. And then I got to realizing that maybe not getting a divorce on Catholic kids would be worse than getting a divorce because of the children, because he was really too hard on the kids when he quit drinking and get married.

00:24:09:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You just beat him to death.

00:24:12:18 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, my mind goes against the situation. You don't have to. Well, I really can't think of one thing.

00:26:09:12 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, there's that anger. What sort of things did you do when you were staying?

00:26:19:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I mean, we just, you know, was going out dancing and drinking up here in the bars with me first. Look, the main thing that would be really too much to do, really. You know, although I.

But every time we take all the kids and go and he's buying stock rifles for the 201.2 rifles and he's gone back getting the boy hunting rifle right here.

00:27:30:05 - Unknown Interviewer: Compared with that, and then experimenting with method lovers.

00:27:33:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: We have we got our gear. Last year.

00:27:35:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Was one.

00:27:37:14 - Unknown Interviewer: Where did you go.

00:27:38:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Right. Went down to that or the lower Saint Mary complete Mary's master, which was something just strictly for my ladies. And then my husband on the table saw something pulled up his brother hunting rifle for the chamber. And that's all he has to hunt with no matter what. Oh, wow. So can you use those during the regular? Yes, you can use them every time.

00:28:03:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But during the special season, they're not anything. You can use the muzzle load, but you can use the muzzle. Voters. When the regular rifles open.

00:28:12:10 - Unknown Interviewer: So when there are many people out hunting during muzzle.

00:28:15:20 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think this was our first year down there. Of course, we we just started to go on the weekends, but we went into a lot of people down there and it was different than running into a hunter up here because, I mean, you know, when you run into 100 up here, you just kind of just go right on.

00:28:30:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But, you know, I mean, you're stuff, but down there, they had to stop and.

00:28:33:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: See what kind of gun the other guy had. You know, because.

00:28:37:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Black powder gun, there's so many variety you can throw on, you know, and so they just everybody had to see what the other one was shooting and so on. And there's different calibers. And I mean, there's a minimum on the caliber for black powder season, but there's a minimum around up to different size calibers and there's different makes different models.

00:29:02:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And it's really interesting. I don't think it was any benefit look just exactly like down there.

00:29:08:22 - Unknown Interviewer: You have your rush and rifle loader. What caliber is it.

00:29:13:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: 50

00:29:15:04 - Unknown Interviewer: my husband has a 54 and he got a short saw shoulder practicing.

00:29:20:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: runner.

00:29:21:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Loads.

00:29:22:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Here with the light load for me and the prints to shoot. And this is where I'm usually practice is very.

00:29:31:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Long.

00:29:33:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And hum. then uses for hunting road for hunting season. And like you said, you had a black and brown shoulder and a black blue Jack were trying to practice with the hunting load. So usually we just shoot it, with the light or dark that we could stand was we are not turning.

00:29:55:13 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. And then it doesn't hurt as.

00:29:58:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You.

00:30:00:23 - Unknown Interviewer: Know, after that, I didn't even really, like, want to past his gun. And then we did love it lighter and but I still haven't tried it.

00:30:10:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Right. Yeah. Try it. It's not really that bad when it's loaded. Right. And they are a lot. I time a not cheaper to shoot than a regular rifle. Really. So sad for my husband. No fun working the bank plant. So I make it in the lab so we don't have to buy it live and move around. And so.

00:30:30:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It makes it a little more fun. Yeah. That's true. When we do them up here, when we're just plinking around, we just make the rounds. Balls, the morning hunts. He's better. it looks more like a regular bullet that he loves to hunt with.

00:30:51:08 - Unknown Interviewer: What do you do for recreation? Well.

You know, when you climb hillsides, we like to bump, up the logging roads. we think, coming back a couple of times on the tractor, we see, just this last couple of weeks, I've been to Saint Mary's and back by myself on my motorcycle because I go down there on business and didn't want to drive the car.

00:32:01:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And I've been to Spokane back in the quad lane, back, and we're going to go to Spokane yesterday on cycles. But we said.

00:32:08:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Take the car and.

00:32:48:21 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you like to water skiing?

00:32:51:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I don't think I ever had a chance to escape room. We haven't bothered about murder now. And we've never gone with my folks. And they've had with murder. Took her skiing.

00:33:06:20 - Unknown Interviewer: What types of wintertime activities did you do when you were young? What you do now?

00:33:52:20 - Unknown Interviewer: And up come down the hill. We can see like the turkey itself.

00:33:57:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Try, but I have nothing I need to throw there. And the craziest thing out for a long time, I have never been down there.

00:34:08:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I can't go back.

00:34:14:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Not in fear of I can't work.

00:34:16:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And like I.

00:34:21:04 - Unknown Interviewer: Definitely. Somebody says that if you really know how to. If you take a lesson from me. Did you usually don't mind giving or listening?

00:34:31:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Right? Right. I'm not. You know, it's just like any other sport. It's carelessness. I mean, from, like, my neighbor to Pat Brooks, because I ride my motorcycle. Because her back. So many people getting hurt and killed on motorcycles, you know. But I have my full respect for that motorcycle. I realize that the 500 to your car, I've had, you know.

00:34:54:04 - Unknown Interviewer: Okay. These jobs that you have, with the engraving license for that, a full time job?

00:35:01:14 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah.

00:35:02:25 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh. Is there any particular reason why you decided to work full time?

00:35:10:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: the main reason why.

00:35:11:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I went to work at Penrose, so I can't now, but I think I had a girlfriend that was applying to get a $10, and I said, well, I found a it might be different, you know, so I put my job application in Sebring. I didn't get on what kind of a better give me the money at the time.

00:35:29:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So I'm, I'm having to work.

00:35:32:22 - Unknown Interviewer: You do it. Would you enjoy working with.

00:35:35:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I do enjoy my job. Really well done. The main reason I quit was the company I have had allergy. At the time. I realized, and the next to the desk and the polishing machines. And I was sick all the time with a cold on me. I didn't have a cold. I didn't realize that the kind of work my allergies were acting up.

00:36:03:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And then after I quit, that's pretty sick. So I quit after found out I had allergies and have to take shots. Them.

00:36:11:20 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you think it's okay just to get rid of the allergy center? Has it really bother you before you work there?

00:36:20:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think.

00:36:20:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Again, without realizing it could be severe that some time I have quite a few close runny noses and so on. And, after I start taking my shots and I never had a cold. So right back to that kind of conclusion my clients come from just allergies bothering me, my origins right back. Okay. Kind of like walking in long.

00:36:46:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It affects my lungs. yeah. With more allergies. Probably close. Yeah. I took shots because I moved to Kellogg. Finally, I went to that bunker for smaller smoke, but I can breathe up here without any shots. well.

00:37:06:06 - Unknown Interviewer: Did you have the energy to,

00:37:09:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: They run the same test on me, and then they gave me, shots, and I had some contract talks to my health, to the job. That cannery I proposed to make applesauce, natural butter.

00:37:27:06 - Myra Jeanne Stark: we got cut off of that. Yeah.

00:37:32:16 - Unknown Interviewer: What do you do? Recommend line or a line? Now?

00:37:35:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Breaking down a water trough. Well, I just did nurse and service water trough two of her fingers for the from their beer ceremonies machine, and then machine cramps around. Let me let go. And then there's the spring comes down and takes the core out. All right. Go. Meanwhile you're grabbing another two apple. And so you're saying the first two apples into the core, apart the other part of peeling them, and then they drop them on for about that close quarters and then close them.

00:38:10:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Why did you take that? You.

00:38:15:00 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Just something for some extra money or.

00:38:17:29 - Unknown Interviewer: Was it come.

00:38:20:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: During the canning season here? But they don't work. You know the first you're going to work part of it here. From here, I think it's sort of from the theme park is that.

00:38:30:19 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, and there's one tiny bit, working with tackle, whether it was part time, if you like doing that, that's one thing and it's part time. That's my question, is to why you have the full time jobs.

00:38:44:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: the situations were different than I need the money more. And, with the temper and very rehearsed memory to know we like to do things a lot. Yeah. So I don't want to be tied down. I want to be a baker and whatever, you know, so I would have to come here for, like, tonight. My hair could get some frosting, but some coconut I can cut up to be a bit tougher.

00:39:09:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I don't I should with the party for me and I get commission off of it. And I don't park straight home because I have to work.

00:39:19:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: My senior year.

00:39:23:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Brothers pepper three other people working here in town. So, we all kind of work there, you know, from Britain. Can't do that party or something. Congrats to them. Which is black. Where the girls come. I go to a prom.

00:39:36:29 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you, you soundtrack work for your own equipment, or is it just that you can get a few extra things? Or is it just add money to the family account?

00:39:49:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: What kind of a lot of all, I'm really. I run into it mainly because I, bored sitting at home and I have a girlfriend, but I have three little ones and she's like coming on and she's been getting her minutes and what? I watch the children. And then we're all in school and and at home all day long watching her children reflect whatever.

00:40:14:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I have something I have to go.

00:40:20:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I like babies till they start to crawl in from there.

00:40:23:25 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And.

00:40:30:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I pretend that it has to do with pediatrics and.

00:40:38:18 - Unknown Interviewer: work. Because, see, it's the future for your children.

00:40:44:25 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah, I know, I just. I do need more. I'm riding the bus driver.

00:40:52:02 - Unknown Interviewer: education job. Do you have any expectations?

00:40:56:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Well, I'm hoping that I have a good chance to go to college, because I feel right now college is important. It's high school. It's when I went to school, so I just really have to have a team get along, I think. And drag race just so that I enjoy going to work. For that, my people at work, at jobs that they don't like and like going to work every morning.

00:41:26:23 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you want to go to college? Green? Yeah. Good. I want to become a nurse. I've never thought about being a doctor.

00:41:36:14 - Myra Jeanne Stark: No, not.

00:41:37:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Really.

00:41:39:08 - Unknown Interviewer: No. Technician. Thank you. Ma'am, I have an expert.

00:41:46:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: She's started about writing for a nurse, and I will start to explain to you the difference between being a nurse and if she would be a lab technician. I mean, there really is a lot more opportunities in being a technician than there is a nurse.

00:41:58:26 - Unknown Interviewer: You belong to, organizations. So you're investigating all the possibilities.

00:42:05:06 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And this is just going up to the high school this year. The first year I'm just getting into having this type of thing. She did not last year. She's ninth grade, which is the cooking guide. I think this year probably should during like teacher nurses, which I belong to or some negative type things because I can get into it a little more than.

00:42:27:12 - Unknown Interviewer: You ever consider, like going back, taking courses so that you could become a nurse.

00:42:35:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I admit, in fact, that when I was in quarantine and then just starting this LPN course now at the college now course, they have the full RV and closed down right now. But I had thought about why not. The children have been afford it and so on that I would enjoy going back to school, maybe becoming a nurse, because at that time my thinking was more towards the LPN and then maybe later going into Spokane being in Oregon, but now we've got the Oregon courses, North Idaho College.

00:43:08:10 - Unknown Interviewer: Are you still concerned?

00:43:11:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think so anymore, Look, I'm before I got remarried and Martin and I just rather be a partner when we get kids down for problem. Life is too big. Motorcycle. Stop or not hungry, work. Come back, be open. Just take up cross country.

00:43:38:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: We're going to have our child back. I'm.

00:43:45:01 - Unknown Interviewer: have you ever thought about having a child of your own again?

00:43:51:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: No. Right. There is enough. We really are. Financially. I give them three, and then we have a boy and some. Some. American. Some kind of like I move. Yeah, we love the kids with that.

00:44:11:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But when I. If I had to be what we go.

00:44:16:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I have.

00:44:20:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I wouldn't get as many as I would have.

00:44:23:22 - Unknown Interviewer: Three and something like that. I mean.

00:44:25:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I know that there's so many things going on.

00:44:28:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Where I sleep. I. We can take her with us now. I gave her the motorcycle. Before she gets a driver's license, she can borrow the property with the bank babysitter. So Chris and I, once we get her the license family for rent, each of the back out behind the baby. Before we had three kids, there was no way we could take our bikes out from work because we have no.

00:44:54:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And so I can't ride on the road. When there's so many things that you have to do, you know, like I can't because of the traveling homeless man.

00:45:12:05 - Unknown Interviewer: of course, what you learned about childbirth, childminding, I assume you had your children had to go home?

00:45:20:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I'm not sure if I want to go through all courses before I had six or not. No, I right, because I had it with. No, at cluttering the clubhouse. It had prenatal classes before you when they taught you something so bad. Natural childbirth. And so I had to learn from that, you know, and then quit being interested in passing.

00:45:45:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I got quite a few books, not technical books, fictional books on childbirth and so on. So I had learn from. That and quit since the time. But I was real interested in terms, like I said, I'd want to be a pediatric nurse, so between writing, the nursing and the children and so on, I'd read paper by. Did you have all the children that have gone through?

00:46:17:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I'm scared of a.

00:46:23:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Year to put up with trouble coming back to come.

00:46:28:15 - Unknown Interviewer: Was it a good experience for you for children? I mean, it was. Did it feel good physically?

00:46:38:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: For the pain and for me, it wasn't that bad. I read Faraday's law or so from childbirth, so it just wasn't any problem. But I'm having problems having my children. I've spent a long time with her, but that wasn't the point, that it was anything that work got seven or anything untapped.

00:47:01:02 - Unknown Interviewer: Just a few women there. It was really a beautiful experience. I don't know what I'm saying. She would almost have another child because of that, but that they only wanted to.

00:47:14:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah, yeah, that's not really right. But I mean, I think a lot of problem is the fact that going into it scared to start with. And I really feel that the natural childbirth courses are well worth anybody's time to go through because, you can learn to diminish the childbirth pain if you know how to react to it programing.

00:47:41:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: When you're scary, you can feel it, can't hurt. So my is that way with the shot or anything else. You just. If you can learn to relax and convince yourself that this isn't going to hurt, it's not going to hurt us. Better. If you're scared it's going to kill me. You know, and I really think that, you can never stop the fact that you need to have problems with some type of a pain reliever sometime that's doing all that they know that's going on, and they're prepared for it to an extent.

00:48:12:17 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It's not as bad as when they go into just cold turkey.

00:48:17:00 - Unknown Interviewer: Okay. I'm I think, what types of occupations for the other two guys?

00:48:21:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah. They have to start meals.

00:48:27:13 - Unknown Interviewer: I want to find out something about your reaction being a minus one. Did you ever thought about being a myers wife? Were you ever concerned about the dangers that.

00:48:36:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: When I married Martin, who was working underground, he was working in the same plant. And then the chance for a big to go underground. Christmas was back in the French time disaster up here. And, I didn't have any qualms burning down underground because I would probably.

00:48:58:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Have abandoned.

00:48:59:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Mine. Worker. There just is. No.

00:49:03:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Not not that an accident.

00:49:05:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: This is the only disaster that we've had. as far as I'm concerned, just the one thing. I mean, it's more dangerous, I think, driving on the highways. And then I was working underground in the mine.

00:49:18:18 - Unknown Interviewer: Had they changed a lot of safety precautions since then.

00:49:22:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I have been I.

00:49:24:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Have asked, for example, here, which is a completely different name and sunshine and worker, if I understood it, I mean, I wasn't sure at the time and I knew nothing of it. The virus here, safety precautions are different from sunshine and of course each your company or different doesn't make me nervous for her, for my older brother.

00:49:47:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And, because I take as much precautions. They. We can still go to work. I mean, you know, I'm here. I sit in the ground. He wouldn't go back to work. Now, the plants for anything are really hurting. He was going down a couple weeks before he went back. And within a certain length of time, I think his first week, he said they were going to come back and think, play like that.

00:50:17:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And of course, and questioning if I have to work. And there he says, I wouldn't feel that way, but I get claustrophobic and I know I went underground. I was quite.

00:50:27:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Okay. I've never heard that the idea.

00:50:32:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Of being confined in mother's name, any of the rooms or how they feel like they're underground or confined down there. So, all right.

00:50:44:16 - Unknown Interviewer: What is it about being underground that you like so much?

00:50:48:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I'm not. I'm not bitter. Bitter?

00:50:51:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I enjoy this job down there.

00:50:53:11 - Myra Jeanne Stark: We really like it.

00:50:55:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Good for me, because I was working here in the timber down in a cinder. I think it's crawling now. It's like, kind of like an elevator thing. But they take the lumber down to the miners. This is what we can get. Chance to become a miner. You know, even that he.

00:51:12:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Enjoyed, like being under there and.

00:51:17:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Safe job. And this is what's important. Very. I'd never have him happy with me. Sad. Maybe there is more danger down there, but as far as I'm concerned, what happens with the difference? You know.

00:51:34:19 - Unknown Interviewer: Are you concerned about the types of pollution that they talk about?

00:51:39:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Kellogg workers money at home in Vermont for years and years ago. And at that time, it was so much worse. Now we I think that that really doing what they can to try to clean it up. And that's bad for veterans. Yeah. But you're right back. They had a real bad day I guess. But I was wrong so didn't really know what's going to I think a lot of it.

00:52:08:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: They need the precautions. Yes. But I think they're going overboard and trying to get them put through, preparing them some someone to come through. I think a medical about it were I don't think it would be quite that drastic.

00:52:21:25 - Unknown Interviewer: Have you taken precautions around the house to keep down and I'm aware no.

00:52:30:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I mean, I keep my house clean. Yeah, but I mean, I don't try to I don't worry about my boys seeing your kids washed their hands with. But for me. Right. So, you know, I think this is where I bought it. And they're getting it because you do see their dirty hands, where my mouth and so on. I think this could be one of the factors that families over here or anything.

00:52:57:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It just puts that right in my, my children are big enough from from a past that break when I get here. In fact, my kids are impressed. But like just the other day and then they can go to bed and they got my report to everyone to come home to be careful, but they need to come back and talk for a while.

00:53:21:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Okay. How long does he have to work out? Let me just tell you where we can get here.

00:53:29:24 - Unknown Interviewer: It'll be interesting to see how it compares with people from children down here.

00:53:34:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I'll be right back, friend for me forever. And I say, I mean, they're grown adults, you know, and, and they're just kind of running from across the pond. They, I mean, I think I just thought, you know.

00:53:49:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Just doing what I can so.

00:53:52:24 - Unknown Interviewer: I can tell you that I like.

00:53:56:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I.

00:54:05:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I want to tell my life.

00:54:08:15 - Unknown Interviewer: I mean, I have to think for a minute. Think the other thing, that we usually ask about. A lot of the questions that we ask are about the depression and things like that, that when this effected your life, did the war affect your life in any way?

00:54:28:17 - Myra Jeanne Stark: not that I can think of, because I was just a year old and Pearl Harbor was formed and bombed, and then my father, gets, my, my son from going to the service and my service.

00:54:47:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Time for the phone call. And for me when? I'm not sure if we were, you know, after Pearl Harbor, not bombing. You know, when the war broke out, my father left. Yeah. And he was in a service band, I remember. I really can't go.

00:55:06:00 - Unknown Interviewer: Overseas.

00:55:07:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Now. He was due to go overseas. Then. The debut from the squadron was to put out. Some come through that they didn't have time for me. He was in the States all the time.

00:55:21:09 - Unknown Interviewer: Was he away from home?

00:55:22:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yes he was.

00:55:24:13 - Unknown Interviewer: Did that affect your life in any way that you remember?

00:55:28:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Well, because I didn't I didn't remember any of it. and so after about, half my parents about spending the first going and bringing it closer to home back then. So it didn't bother me. And my mother's had better numbers in the house that the. And so.

00:55:57:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: We just went.

00:55:59:24 - Unknown Interviewer: What about grandma?

00:56:02:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: No, no, my family was a I mean, we realized what was going on and so on. And as kids were being raised, but, my brother was expecting to get called back where I expected to go in the service. I mean, that's it that he did volunteer.

00:56:23:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: For the Navy, and he's been in the Navy now for nine years, Yeah.

00:56:29:12 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And that's the way I feel about my birth. I mean, if there was some kind of, national emergency deferring me and in the services. Minor old enough to go, I would be very unhappy here. Probably back from disarmament program to Canada as a hobby or something, because, I mean, if they're going to move here, they have to fight for it, too, if it's necessary.

00:56:54:22 - Unknown Interviewer: How did you feel about the Vietnamese war?

00:56:59:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think we could have done more to help we do it. I think we just sit back and wait, and I feel maybe we can run in there and run a little more. That made my career change the way it went. I didn't like the idea of sitting here as advisory, starting and getting shot up and now that's not even taking back.

00:57:22:14 - Unknown Interviewer: You would have just gone in there and done something and gotten out rather than sticking around and not doing that.

00:57:27:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Right. So I, I feel bad. I mean, of course I wasn't there and you get so many different things. Yeah. One way in the other before you just are not sure. But I think we should in fact, or else we should put money in and bank something. It's gotten out little.

00:57:46:16 - Unknown Interviewer: Did your parents expect for you to go on to school.

00:57:51:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think I would like to be in. So I was pregnant, I couldn't, so that was.

00:58:01:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And they had I think they required me to adopt her out so that I could go on that I got to keep my baby. But I prefer to keep the house more than, let's.

00:58:18:01 - Unknown Interviewer: let's there. Aside from your parents, how is the reaction?

00:58:23:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Your friends told your bank partner.

00:58:31:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I didn't have a whole lot of friends and few close friends. I had just, you know, it was taken for with my sister. That's now. But I just can't go back and round. But anybody can make a mistake, and then you can go back to it. That.

00:58:48:19 - Unknown Interviewer: Did you know her much about birth control at the time?

00:58:51:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: No, I yeah, well, I just, I have anyone to have been out since that time from.

00:59:03:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But I was taken over.

00:59:07:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So. Great. I really didn't know that much about it. Really? Yeah.

00:59:16:29 - Unknown Interviewer: you don't have to answer. It's okay. If the same thing would happen to your daughter, would you want her to get married or would you be more like to just keep her child without getting married?

00:59:28:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: we already proved that she was now her and the break up because, my, I need to get married because I said I couldn't I terms for having me. But then she was my first husband, and I got the first Marion County baby she wasn't here for anyhow. So yeah, I just. But then we really did that much.

00:59:51:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But as far as I was concerned, to get married before and just rest time and effort became one number one complex been then anyhow. So. And like I said number of I don't think on it was there at the time when I was pregnant and

01:00:14:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think she was pregnant before she gets married.

01:00:17:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But if she were her, it's her decision. But if she was to get married, that's her decision. And she was wrong or not.

01:00:28:29 - Unknown Interviewer: How do you make family decisions and how do you make decisions that involved your children?

01:00:38:06 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Well, for years two, I was around, depending on what I regret. But whoever's around makes the decision as to whether Frank gonna do something about it or if it's something really drastic, then my husband, my carpenter, even Cincinnati.

01:00:55:21 - Unknown Interviewer: Your family decisions. Do your children take apart?

01:01:01:14 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Sometimes. Not too often. You know, my husband and I, the thinking that sometimes we. Mom turn behind is.

01:01:13:16 - Unknown Interviewer: husband. And we're considering taking another job and living at home and having fun. And that sort of decision.

01:01:22:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: If you want to take another job.

01:01:27:16 - Unknown Interviewer: You would choose go about. Did you have any qualms about moving to California? You know?

01:01:37:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah, we were living in Cleveland. Program at the time. He was working the change here. Yeah, pulling them out of divorce rate. Make sure it's like my,

01:01:52:21 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you have a garden here?

01:01:54:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: No.

01:01:55:10 - Unknown Interviewer: Did you have a garden for mine?

01:01:59:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: lifestyle and plant. Plant a few things they didn't have to give you another thing to take care of.

01:02:07:17 - Myra Jeanne Stark: The gardener kind of priority then. No.

01:02:11:02 - Unknown Interviewer: Have you ever canned food or fresh fruit.

01:02:13:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Oh yeah. I've until the last couple of years that canned everything here that, especially the green beans department before they got, I didn't have to bother picking them. I had friends that had the big, machine pickers come and pick them, and. And I could just have what I wanted to get the machines and stuff. Can lots of beans left.

01:02:37:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Can't switch on your door. Carry?

01:02:42:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah.

01:02:43:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I do blood work. But when you look at those shelves, grow for you and see what you done anyhow. Warehouse work.

01:02:48:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You don't. You're never given.

01:02:57:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You're given what?

01:03:03:03 - Unknown Interviewer: I never really thought about that.

01:03:05:14 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It's kind of like baking bread or anything else, you know, where you get something that you can see it, you know, but you accomplished it, sucker. You know, I mean, when I drink solvents, I'll put in the closet. Nobody sees that. But when you've got your canning all done, you can go down and brag for a year about what you did on canning.

01:03:23:04 - Unknown Interviewer: You break from fresh.

01:03:25:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I did for a while. I, I take spurts, I go on for the road, baked bread for quite a while now get off on another. Can you do.

01:03:34:25 - Unknown Interviewer: Something else.

01:03:36:17 - Unknown Interviewer: One of the tractor can.

01:03:38:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Be your car? Oh, knitting or painting?

01:03:42:25 - Unknown Interviewer: No.

01:03:43:09 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Stop selling Tupperware.

01:03:47:19 - Unknown Interviewer: Just know what type of training you.

01:03:52:00 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It's your art kicks and drag campaigns for your corporation. You just, keep concert pictures.

01:04:02:28 - Unknown Interviewer: And print on.

01:04:05:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: The phone. That could mean you're having talent. That better painting for homestead farm?

01:04:10:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Because an artist. I am not.

01:04:15:19 - Unknown Interviewer: You, work on the motorcycle. Car. And you can.

01:04:19:06 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Afford. Oh, little did I not smoke German motorcycles. I mean, I ain't really gotten. We just got into this last year. I don't know that much about that. I don't junker cars for years, so. I mean, I know how to. You get one. Sorry if it don't start, you know, it's something fairly simple or something like that, but I'm not.

01:04:42:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I'm mechanically inclined, but I just could never get enough practice to know what I'm doing, for sure.

01:04:48:16 - Unknown Interviewer: Would you like to learn more about that?

01:04:51:11 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I wouldn't mind learning mechanic so that when I was in high school, my heart stopped to work in mechanics. Of course, at that time I was very upset about I wanted to be a nurse. I come out of high school in mechanics and mostly boys, but so I could do it. And I don't mind getting dirty and greasy and what have you.

01:05:15:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Do they any courses.

01:05:17:21 - Unknown Interviewer: Or were you interested in taking them? When you're in high school and out there?

01:05:21:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I don't think there was a mechanics course in woodworking for the boys and that type of stuff in mechanics. And like I said, at that time, I was really upset because I had so mechanical ability. Side counselor told me I'd be a good mechanic. My grandma says, what has the percentages even in that? Because they're nurses that work with you, people that are in the iron lung.

01:05:49:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So on some of these machines have to know mechanics to make extent to the or to get the machine working right away in case of the chinstrap patient means father machine.

01:06:02:29 - Unknown Interviewer: So I really thought of it.

01:06:04:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: On that terms.

01:06:05:28 - Unknown Interviewer: But is there anything really more than to be important?

01:06:12:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Okay. If you were a woman? not really. I am.

01:06:21:03 - Unknown Interviewer: Kind of.

01:06:21:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Anti women's lib to an extent. I mean, I really feel that women's lib had purpose when it started out, but I think some of it's getting carried a little too far. For instance, when a woman is doing the same type of job, it's men. Definitely they should get the same pay, but I don't think they should squawk and try to get every job that every man has.

01:06:44:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I mean, just like up here at Bunker Hill, there's a lot. Must the girls come up there and work? And now they're winding down in the main. Well, there's no facilities down the mine for the women to be working alongside of the men. And, one of the guys we at first used to help the girls come up to Bunker Hill.

01:07:05:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I like to think plants help women. So on for now. They're kind of the girls who can do it on their own. And I don't think a woman should have a job. Pays the same as man if she can't do the whole job, she has color. Somebody else can help to do her share of the job she shares and panic.

01:07:25:10 - Unknown Interviewer: Whatever. They holler now or they're really doing it on the ground.

01:07:29:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: they.

01:07:30:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I really don't know.

01:07:31:09 - Myra Jeanne Stark: How it is now because like I said, my husband is underground where they don't have to sit there for a while. Thing is to kind of halfway expect the guys, you know, see the real world to having the guy come help me or whatever, you know, guy kind of gotten away from now. And I don't know just how much the girls are doing now to carry over to their for jobs.

01:07:53:09 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You know.

01:07:54:11 - Unknown Interviewer: When you say, I feel I need some ground time, better restroom. Are there any facilities for them?

01:08:02:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Oh, well, there's there's places where, there is a restroom type thing. You most of the time I just as long as it's urinating, it's just in the ditches. And then they just don't even bother. They just. There's ditches with water. And then you go to.

01:08:22:15 - Unknown Interviewer: So that doesn't matter as long as there's men here. But there are women in there.

01:08:26:06 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It was complicated. All right.

01:08:29:11 - Unknown Interviewer: What are the other things about women? For years and six.

01:08:34:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Oh, I just think they're making too big of a deal of it. I mean, like I said, I do feel that when they start out that they have too much or too much ground because there were women that were doing the same type job, man, they were getting almost paid because they were a woman, instead of getting the same pay rate as a man that, they're carrying it to such an extreme male.

01:08:57:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But no matter what you're doing or what kind of thing it is, whatever the men have it to now, she's a woman. Libber let her do it herself, you know? I mean, they all they're all taking the opinion that all of the women want women's lib. And personally, all I command open the door for me. Here you have the couch.

01:09:18:24 - Myra Jeanne Stark: It's too heavy to move. Holler for the curb. No, I mean, I can't see but my back when I can get a.

01:09:24:20 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Man to help me.

01:09:26:17 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Change a tire, I can change a car, Carter. But some man comes along and we'll playhouse help give him a change for her and the room. A lot of this because, I mean, you know, now that he's older, do it herself, you know, and or used to be, anytime a woman is stuck alongside the old man would always stop and help her.

01:09:50:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: In my old times, you know, I been out on the freeway in the rain, changing the tire. Nobody would stop to help her. There was a time when you didn't even have to worry about because the man come home and do it for you.

01:10:07:12 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. What do you think about women.

01:10:09:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Work and for their children or for your. Well.

01:10:15:17 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think there's.

01:10:17:20 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Different ways of looking at your nanny is different temperament. Some mothers let me know like there's some mothers that are really, really content to stay home with their children all the time. Me, I need to get away from mine. Or I just know some part of the reason for my tough work, because it's like, give me a few hours away from the kids and so on, and yet there's I've got one girlfriend that she's got two children of her own.

01:10:46:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: She benefits children all the time. Thank you. As good as can be. And I would be pulling my hair out if I had to put up with kids all the time. And I think sometimes I get better care and more attention from mother when mother's been away for a while.

01:11:03:20 - Unknown Interviewer: Is that where have you been?

01:11:06:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah.

01:11:08:01 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I don't go running around screaming quite as much, you know, and we're able to have more things and do more things work at your home because I do have extra money. But on the other hand, there's mothers that are just pregnant and they're just really meant to be at home with their children. That's all they want. And I think kind of up to individual family situation.

01:11:37:11 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I couldn't.

01:11:37:27 - Unknown Interviewer: Stand to be home with.

01:11:39:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: A whole bunch of kids all the time. I just I'm too nervous. In high school.

01:11:48:13 - Unknown Interviewer: what do you do as far as family activities at all here?

01:11:53:20 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Oh, we do lots of things. We got all these cars together. We cut the motorcycle down or go fishing. We take the kids some of the times we go hunting and.

01:12:09:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Usually the kids are with us. Library filming or the theater. Of course. Marianne's babysit for me at the same moment in proper time. I think it's really.

01:12:21:20 - Unknown Interviewer: No matter what we do this year for object.

01:12:28:04 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Classes here, they're free for autograph readers.

01:12:31:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And we don't ask for that often. And then when we're not going somewhere, she has the freedom of going. Why? She wants to like she wants to live extended like lots and lots of. She walks at the park or out chasing around countryside when they do on some certain summer time, we have Linda with us.

01:12:57:12 - Unknown Interviewer: Another term? Yeah.

01:13:02:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So she calls me mom.

01:13:05:20 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I know. Yeah, there's a big family there.

01:13:09:09 - Unknown Interviewer: For a while, and you know, I, she wasn't here, so. Yeah.

01:13:15:09 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So we're down pretty well. Just, She wraps Martin around her finger, I almost.

01:13:25:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah.

01:13:29:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Guess what? She wraps Martin around her finger, doesn't she? When she wants to do something and I don't let her she go, sees Martin.

01:13:41:15 - Unknown Interviewer: I'm. Damn. You're fine. You get your driver's license right.

01:13:45:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: So they both agreed on that?

01:13:50:16 - Unknown Interviewer: Earthquake. Vietnam track.

01:13:53:00 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah. You ready to go? I, for one, give my think for having you here. Oh.

01:14:00:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Besides, what she makes me, she make me a nervous wreck when she was trying to learn to drive before she could drive, he said I was ready for her.

01:14:09:21 - Unknown Interviewer: No, I'm not the only reason.

01:14:11:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I just about. I just scared part.

01:14:14:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Of my wits. I said I'm a nervous.

01:14:16:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Wreck when my car.

01:14:20:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: We come round the corner and I wasn't sure she was gonna miss the pickup that was coming around near the wire.

01:14:25:00 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Not really. She gets. Forget it.

01:14:27:18 - Unknown Interviewer: I think I would have a hard time keeping someone very dry.

01:14:31:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You know, I think it really is easier for, another person to teach sometimes than for you to teach your own children. These brings. I'm not sure what it is. And different person has more patience. I know I have more patience at times with other people's children than I do my own. I learn. But on the other hand, I think that if I remember being too close, I think at times people to really get the communication across on you expect more of your child than you could, maybe somebody else's.

01:15:06:28 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I mean, you, some of the other kids, maybe you think, well, maybe they don't know me better, you know? But you're you're sure that they should know better.

01:15:16:14 - Unknown Interviewer: When you think about their houses across.

01:15:19:20 - Myra Jeanne Stark: The river in warmer weather, we're in here on.

01:15:25:03 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Oh, well, it's all over. I mean, what's the difference whether it's in the house or not?

01:15:29:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: No street.

01:15:33:00 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I mean, at least some girls are being honest about what they are doing. And yet I as I understand most time the houses are kept pretty clean. They are checked in with doctors for the girls on the streets downtown. And where there's men, there's like going to be prostitutes of one sort or another.

01:15:53:16 - Unknown Interviewer: do you think it has an effect on the community and instead it could affect her bad affect? Her home. Why do you still have girlfriends? They come down here, they, you know, oh, this is my country.

01:16:09:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: But right now we have seen.

01:16:11:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: That, you know, I have a contractor group. So, you know, I mean.

01:16:19:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I don't see that we don't. I'm not in front of cars. Right when we come back and I see your car gone. Yeah, right. We go out while we stayed.

01:16:36:11 - Myra Jeanne Stark: In close contact. Call us to talk to be home back then. Well, how would you do that? Because you don't.

01:16:44:16 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You right now, you know.

01:16:46:09 - Unknown Interviewer: They try to I guess it's like it's not going to fix them. Well.

01:16:52:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Great people come through and they turn it on. And what you can never figure out because they're know they don't want to go with your car.

01:17:02:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Three months ago got up. So the guys I'll going to.

01:17:07:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Want you know I.

01:17:15:24 - Unknown Interviewer: It affects the whole morality of the farm or.

01:17:20:10 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Just the women have decided that that's what they want to do. I don't know, but most of the people, pretty.

01:17:26:23 - Unknown Interviewer: Much.

01:17:27:07 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Guys, to go on the road for from here, from here, you know, because the water in the Gulf of Mexico come out. In fact,

01:17:40:25 - Unknown Interviewer: I think since.

01:17:41:23 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I moved back to go come up there, you know, you know.

01:17:51:22 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Yeah. But those are the girls on the street. Then I'll be there regardless. The one's in the house. You don't very. Most the girls that work in the houses have got families. You never. You know who they are. So, I mean, the the house and those aren't affecting. It's just the girls themselves are on the streets. They're going.

01:18:15:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: You're talking about where she was asking about the house.

01:18:18:26 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Oh my God, what about when I come to the house when I could.

01:18:28:13 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Well, like I said, where there's where there's men, there's women, there's that. And so it's a certain amount of prostitution. No, not really. That's behind the covers or out on the street or whatever. And it's been going on for years, and I don't think they're ever going to get rid of prostitutes.

01:18:46:06 - Unknown Interviewer: How do you do you think it's safe to walk? It's going to go on and on.

01:18:50:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I do it all the time.

01:18:53:02 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I walk.

01:18:53:27 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Walk out on.

01:18:56:00 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you think it's safer, more.

01:19:00:15 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I wouldn't have a that walk in Wall Street. Same one I do. But when I'm down here.

01:19:07:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think.

01:19:07:21 - Myra Jeanne Stark: I think a lot of.

01:19:09:03 - Unknown Interviewer: Prostitution.

01:19:10:29 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Would change that.

01:19:13:08 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Think that there's a possibility. I mean, there's going to certain.

01:19:21:18 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Branches, especially where there was the miners up here where there's not and don't necessarily have wives and so on that my husband was talking about there's several other guys I've got to pass and so on, and possibly it might affect them to where they would bother some girl on the street. I don't know what that would look like.

01:19:43:05 - Myra Jeanne Stark: Most people would go.

01:19:44:19 - Myra Jeanne Stark: And hop like last night. You,
