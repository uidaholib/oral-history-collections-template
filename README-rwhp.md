# rwhp notes

This is a customized collection.

There are a mix of items: 

- oral_history - has an MP3, and might have pdf transcript, pdf summary, and/or images
- compound_oral_history - has more than one MP3, and might have pdf transcript, pdf summary, and/or images
- compound_object - does not have an MP3, but has a pdf transcript, pdf summary, and/or images
- pdf - has pdf transcript only

"rwhp_deleted-items.csv" lists a set of Items that had photographs only, but do not currently have an audio or oral history transcript (as of March 2024). 
These were originally included in the digital collection, however, the team decided it was confusing to have these image-only items with no context.
The items are digitally preserved in the Spec partition of the Archive Drive.
