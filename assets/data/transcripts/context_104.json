    "description": "Terry and Kam will discuss the contemporary Black experience in Idaho. Ranging from growing up and living in Idaho, gender, queerness, and other life experiences, they both will highlight how all these play into the intersectionality that is not only the Black experience but also the human experience. United States Navy Veteran, Graduate School of Social Work at Boise State Alum Terrence (Terry) Scraggins (He/Him), LSW is from Boise, ID. He recently graduated from Boise State University with a BA in Social Work with a minor in Family Studies. Terry is an Idaho foster alumnus as well as US Navy Veteran. Upon graduation, he joined the mere 3% of foster alumni who have the privilege to graduate with a postsecondary degree. He is also the first individual in his family to graduate with a degree. Terry successfully completed an internship with Family and Children Services and is employed with a governmental agency. Terry sits on the Board of Directors for a local non-profit organization in the Boise area. He continues to help advocate for the LGBTQ+ community by successfully publishing a policy report that was addressed to Congress in Washington D.C. with Senator Wyden [OR] and the Senate Finance Committee throughout the summer of 2018. Terry also presented on how to support and empower LGBTQ+ foster youth in February 2020 for the University of Oklahoma. He is currently in the process of creating a podcast focused on social justice matters. Aspiring to return to D.C. one day, Terry has plans to obtain his Master’s degree either in Social Work or Public Policy (or both,) and continue to advocate for social justice matters. Kam Diaz (They/Them) is a GLAAD campus ambassador and recipient of the Boise State Inclusive Excellence award.",
