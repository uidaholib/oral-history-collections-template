Riché Richardson ,[00:32:51:11],00:33:37:16,"The large bus and is pictured here on screen installation display most viscerally climaxes the museum's emphasis on temporal things. The busses painted green, gold and beige to resemble the one on which parks was arrested in 1955. However, a number of features accorded a futuristic aura. The larger size and rectangular shape, the larger than average bus sees the wider owl and the robot driver named Mr. Rivers, hoist over a dashboard with gadgets resembling those on spaceships in science fiction films.",literature

The bus is framed through its naming and appearance as a time machine. The installation of the Giant bus is a space designed to look larger than life from the perspective of a child, and to provide a more imaginative tour to engage the history of the Montgomery Bus boycott.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:34:06:15],00:34:49:00,"The bus is parked in a large open warehouse. Light displays space framed by black metal poles connected to a host of wires and steam pumps that one might see in an industrial factory and must be boarded by walking down a long L-shaped ramp lined with metal rails that lead up to his entrance. Once the passenger is seated, Mr. Rivets starts the engine, and the bus uses a host of special effects such as vibrations, flashing lights, steam, and sound to create the sensation of motion features that draw in the senses and create the illusion that the bus itself is a machine.",labor
Riché Richardson ,[00:34:49:02],00:35:36:16,"An overhead video screen on the bus becomes the focal point. As a video narrated by the actress Tanya Stewart emerges. Audiences may remember Doctor Stuart from film productions such as A Time to Kill, for instance, a parallel to the feature that begins the tour in the main museum, and by that I mean that in the General Rosa Parks Museum, the one that was, initially open to the public, there are video screens and backgrounds narrated by a video that help to prime and inform the audience and visitors about civil rights history so that they take a journey, into that past.",cinema;migration
Riché Richardson ,[00:35:36:16],00:35:48:01,And it's made this very visceral and brought to life in that encounter. Even in the main museum.,
Riché Richardson ,[00:35:48:03],00:36:41:15,"The main exhibition cast is tourist as a pedestrian and ushers them on a walk through the main exhibition movement that alludes to the day to day material conditions and practices that enable the mass Montgomery bus boycott, but alternatively stages an imaginative ride at the Children's Museum. And so, while the main museum at the Rosa Parks Museum takes its visitors through the, you know, the literal historical, experience and narrative of the Montgomery Bus boycott, it's intriguing that the Children's Museum takes a very different approach because it encourages much more imaginative engagement and overview of history, even though they're like, on the bus, the, the story that's that Doctor Stewart narrates are also very,",cinema;literature
Riché Richardson ,[00:36:42:18],00:37:22:20,"historically grounded. And, there are reenactments of signal moments in history, including of the Dred Scott case that underscore that Rosa Parks, this encounter with James Blake on the bus wasn't the first one that, happened in history. It acknowledges all of the various precursors to show that, there was a longer lineage in terms of resistance to, humiliations and degradations of blacks in public spaces spanning back to the antebellum era.",history;conflict
Riché Richardson ,[00:37:22:22],00:37:54:07,"Time and travel, in the sense popularized through science fiction, surfaces as the central motif in the video, as the tourist goes back in time 150 years, an imaginative journey into the past signaled by the physical vibrations of the bus. It is notable that the naming of this bus installation invokes the H.G. Wells novel The Time Machine, which popularized the concept of time travel and expanded the possibilities for imagining phenomenon.",literature;migration

The, and I should say about Mr. Rivets that he's interesting because he's a robot, and so he's the stand in, we might say, for James Blake on the bus, but, presented as a cyborg like figure.",literature
Riché Richardson ,[00:38:33:03],00:39:01:13,"And so it's intriguing. How Mr. Rivets as a figure invokes notions of the post-human as well as the post-racial in certain ways, but not in a reactionary way that, we we frequently hear that, repress the issues, but just acknowledge the, diversity of the human spectrum. So that's another intriguing thing to me about the display.",culture

And that museum is actually now on display in Detroit. I mean, that bus is now, available on display in a museum in Detroit. The young audiences toward whom the institution pitches this tour can be thought of as an extension of the youth mentored by parks during her lifetime, a group home the recurrent maternal metaphor is associated with her also played a vital role in constituting forced movements and migration that attended an era of modernity and that were intricately linked to slavery, are placed on this time machine by the imagining",literature

In this space, the hope and potential looking toward the year 2055 is an indispensable complement for thinking back on the historic 1955. The installation registers the axis of temporal notes from past to present, and constitutes a vision that dislodges parts from romantic and nostalgic narratives of civil rights history as it facilitates her framing as a premiere revolutionary and as a woman who made National a national impact on ending segregation, but whose significance is global and universal.",history
Riché Richardson ,[00:40:39:18],00:41:15:03,"While the shift, given its materialist linkages to the African slave trade, has recurrently functioned as a symbol of slavery and the oppression of African diaspora and subjects in the Western world, the bus in this installation, as the, emerges as the primary symbol that encompasses post-civil rights struggles against Jim Crow and the journey on to New horizons.

Riché Richardson ,[00:42:55:14],00:43:22:00,"That's one of the, main things that I argue in my recent book, Emancipation of Daughters.

Doug Exton,[00:45:10:08],00:45:29:08,"Thank you so much for the wonderful presentation and all the information, the background you provided. I really appreciate it. And I would like to assume that all the attendees also appreciated it. The first question I was going to ask you is if you can describe the mammy stereotype a little bit, because for me, that's just something I haven't heard of.",
Doug Exton,[00:45:29:10],00:45:36:11,"So I was just curious if you can elaborate on that a little bit more on how, you know, she really moved forward with changing that.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:45:36:13],00:46:25:12,"Absolutely. So, and this drive and a lot of other things as well, I think. But, the mammy stereotype was really part of the plantation myth that began to crystallize in the antebellum era as, a way to rationalize slavery. During that time. And the mammy figure was typically presented as someone who was plump and, often asexual and who was dedicated to the care and nurturance of the, the children of the of the master class, even to the point of literally serving as a wet nurse and in ways that neglected her own children in some cases if she had children.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:46:25:14],00:46:47:19,"But the idea was that she was, she was she was idealized and romanticized as a servant who knew her place and stayed in it and didn't really question her status in any significant way. And there are counterparts like, you know, that the uncle figure of the antebellum era emerged as a key, stark stereotype of, black masculinity.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:46:47:19],00:47:35:00,"That's another image that I've studied in my research. But the mammy stereotype was materialized in American culture, in advertising, through the Aunt Jemima. Image, the the logo that eventually became a trademark during the mid 1920s of Quaker. And that was, recently removed. Actually, I, I wrote an op ed in the New York Times in 2015 urging the removal of Aunt Jemima precisely because of some of those deeper and more problematic, aspects of, her, her background on the surface, I think she was associated with, romance and even nostalgia.",education
Riché Richardson ,[00:47:35:00],00:48:20:14,"But if we, we, we take a deeper look, you know, it's, it's a very unsettling image. And so that national conversation that I ended up, becoming a part of, last year. But the thing about figures such as Rosa Parks, the thing that I thought that's really fascinating is that notions of the maternal are associated with and attached to, Rosa Parks at the national level, but without replay those stereotypes or without being shadowed by their residue.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:48:20:16],00:48:55:17,"And I think this is important. It's she represents an interesting point of contrast as well, because if we look at the history of Aunt Jemima, she, she was nationally abstracted, and, and there was, a serious national fascination with her to the point that in, in 1923, the daughters of the Confederacy, petition to erect a monument like a national monument to her in her honor.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:48:55:19],00:49:39:02,"But it's unsettling and problematic that this spectacle of black femininity, often obscured and erased the concrete and real contributions of, black women in the United States and throughout the diaspora. An illustration for us. This goes back to 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition, when civil rights leaders, prominent cultural figures such as Ida B Wells were denied the opportunity to participate and to be included.",migration
Riché Richardson ,[00:49:39:04],00:50:05:14,"But, Nancy Green was, featured in an exhibition and, larger than life flour barrel whipping pancakes. And that was a hit. You know, it was a top attraction. And so we have to raise questions about what we lose, what we don't see when the focus is so much on stereotypes.",
Doug Exton,[00:50:07:17],00:50:24:20,"Yeah. I think that does raise a really good point. You know, even what you talked about earlier, that romance of like, the antebellum, you know, I think at surface level, a lot of it can seem very attractive. But once you start digging deeper, you know, and exploring the other aspects of it, but that aren't just the face value.",
Doug Exton,[00:50:24:22],00:50:28:09,There is a lot larger of a story that went on.,
Riché Richardson ,[00:50:28:11],00:50:31:07,Right? Right.,
Doug Exton,[00:50:31:09],00:50:54:12,"And also in your book you do talk about, you know, other prominent women, you know, such as Marcell, Obama and Beyonce. And I was going to ask you, what role do you think? You know, music and pop culture have really played in, you know, the identity of black womanhood because I think, you know, especially in the rap and R&B scene now, you see a lot more black women come to the forefront.",
Doug Exton,[00:50:54:14],00:51:03:19,"You know, as musicians in those. Or so I was wondering, you kind of how pop culture has been a role in all of that?",
Riché Richardson ,[00:51:03:21],00:51:38:12,"Yes, yes. Well, I definitely think that, pop culture over time has served as a vital, platform on which many, black women have been able to establish voices, including and to the point that they become global icons. We can think, for instance, of, artists such as Diana Ross who are iconic at this point. Whitney Houston is another powerful illustration.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:51:38:14],00:52:25:24,"And yes, nowadays, artists such as Beyoncé have also gained salience and iconicity through music, circulation and commodification in the popular realm. For black women, can be a double edged sword, in part because, the visibility, as in the case of Aunt Jemima, for instance, visibility and sexual secularity are not always indicators of agency. And in fact, paradoxically, they can they can signal, voiceless ness and, and a lack of agency.",music
Riché Richardson ,[00:52:26:01],00:53:02:17,"So that can be very complicated even when there's this, this fascination and visibility, it doesn't necessarily signal. It's not a signpost of, of power. So, I think that that's, that's a problem. But, you know, these realms of also and in my book, I'm talking about, how politics is the pathway to, shaping iconicity in a similar way for a range of of black women leaders, and activists, including Rosa Parks.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:53:02:19],00:53:31:22,"But, popular culture has also played a role in circulate stereotypes of black women as well. So, we have to, you know, raise questions about what is at stake when we have hip hop that that, yes, in some cases, we see, black women, you know, like Queen Latifah, for instance. MC Lyte, there's a, there's a history of black women who have come to voice within hip hop.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:53:31:22],00:54:33:22,"Salt-N-Pepa. Just a range of artists, but it's also a around that has has, circulated very demeaning and and misogynistic images of black women and, you know, linking them to, you know, pathological behavior and promoting their devaluation. And so I don't necessarily find much empowering in that aspect of popular music. In my work in BRC studies, I, I've really appreciated and, had a chance to analyze Beyonce's origins in the US South and Houston, Texas, and then her early days and Destiny's Child, and how she has come to draw on her position as a global icon to, participate in, in, activism and including more recent activist movements.",music
Riché Richardson ,[00:54:34:22],00:55:04:07,"And so that's just interesting because she I've argued in my own research that she presents and like a more inclusive idea of democracy that we can all learn from regardless of, you know, what we might think about her or, or the politics that, you know, she, supports, you know, because we have to really think about, the best models and possibilities for advancing American democracy continuing forward.",education
Riché Richardson ,[00:55:04:09],00:55:19:21,"And so in her project lemonade, and particularly in formation, I argue that Beyoncé birth, a formation nation of sorts. And so that's one of the things that fascinates me.",
Doug Exton,[00:55:19:23],00:55:45:19,"Yeah. I mean, I've completely and I love the song formation, but the music video for that song in particular, I think was really impactful for a lot of people, in the sense that it really touched on a lot of cultural aspects, especially within black culture, that, you know, typically hadn't really been either talked about or even just seen, you know, on that national scale in such a digestible way.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:55:45:21],00:56:10:06,"Yes, yes, I love that word, digestible. And it's even snackable like in some ways, yeah, I think it was. And when it debuted the night before the Super Bowl, and then she went out and did the performance. Yeah, that there was a lot of power in that. And I think that visually it was very compelling and captivating, to be sure.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:56:10:08],00:56:41:20,"And if we look at the histories that she was dealing with this black liberation movement and civil rights, but more so looking at the Black power, some aspects of the Black Panther movement, even Malcolm X, and just, recollecting the imagery like, see, she literally used all of that in her Super Bowl performance. But the actual video, which just I think, it, it powerfully examines forms of violence that continues to be perpetrated in some cases.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:56:41:20],00:57:10:20,"And I think it was powerful for also presenting and, and going back to the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina for a new generation, because this came out in 2016. And so a little over a decade, after the incident, the tragedy in 2005. And so maybe younger audiences were not as aware of the impact of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:57:10:22],00:57:22:04,"And so, it's significant that formation, reflected on on that history and this continuing impact.",
Doug Exton,[00:57:22:06],00:57:47:12,"You know, I, I totally agree, because, you know, for me, I don't really remember Hurricane Katrina, but, you know, all I know is that it was just a horrible, you know, event, you know, due to the impacts and stuff. So I think her being able to kind of refresh that, but not in your typical way. You're kind of giving it a new light and a new breath, you know, really helped.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:57:47:14],00:58:22:08,"Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And reminded, our audience of the environmental and ecological disaster that it was and that the importance of continuing to, you know, pay attention to, those, those issues. Yeah. And then homecoming, the more recent, production that she's done, I think was also interesting for, pay on to historically black colleges and universities and, and traditions associated with them, like sororities and fraternities and marching bands.",history
Riché Richardson ,[00:58:22:14],00:58:53:22,"And again, you know, this isn't often, thought about in the American mainstream. You know, with Kamala Harris's, election as the vice president of the United States and her roots at Howard, we're hearing more in the national mainstream about HBCUs. And then there's also Reverend, Raphael Warnock, who was elected to the Senate, actually knew him as an undergraduate when I was in the Atlanta University Center at Spelman, when he was at Morehouse.",
Riché Richardson ,[00:58:54:02],00:59:16:23,"And then Stacey Abrams actually was also, at Spelman at the time that I was there. And so these are now prominent national figures with origins at HBCUs. But even, you know, when and I think that that reflects a much longer history and legacy. You know, Doctor Keene, for instance, was a graduate Morehouse, Julian Bond, Mary Ann Wright element and so many other figures.",history
Riché Richardson ,[00:59:16:23],00:59:52:06,"But we don't necessarily hear about such institutions in the media, let alone traditions associated with them, like homecoming. And now it's actually about that time in, in a lot of places, although, you know, restructured in many ways because of the pandemic, but beyond, say, embraces and celebrates and showcases those legacies and without, interestingly enough, taking sides. If in homecoming, you don't see any specific schools, mention any specific bans mentioned, because that could get really out very quickly.",history
Doug Exton,[00:59:52:08],01:00:06:24,"Yeah, there's a lot of rivalries going on there, but unfortunately we are out of time. So I'd like to say thank you to everyone for attending and thank you to both of you, Doctor Richardson, and to David for the wonderful introduction and presentations.",
