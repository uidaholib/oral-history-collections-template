So the genesis of the refugee resettlement program here in the United States started in with the Disabled Displaced Persons Act of 1948 at the in the wake of the end of the World War two.

And I just thought we'd take a few steps back into what that looked like in Idaho, because this is the general US picture. The genesis of the program in Idaho started in 1975. The then governor, John Evans, was able to resettle people to allow people to come to the states through the Indochinese Refugee Resettlement program, and at that time, the people who are being resettled were the refugees from Vietnam, from Laos, from Cambodia and other southeast countries, Southeast Asia countries.",

Maybe because of the fires, for example, like the fires we're currently experiencing or some other disaster that has forced you to leave your home, then we have about 26 million refugees worldwide and 3.5 million people who are seeking asylum.",

      "words": "I know people will ask the difference between what's the difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker? And I normally say it's kind of like the difference between seeking permission or asking for forgiveness. So a refugee is somebody who gets permission to gain entry into the third country of resettlement before they get there. So all your paperwork, all your background information, all that is done before you get into the country and an asylum seeker is somebody who, unlike a refugee, is able to gain access into the country.",

However, you're unable to go back into your country because of the well-founded fear, and so people end up staying and seeking asylum. So like I said, it's either seeking permission or seeking forgiveness of the groups that, of the refugees, of the people who run away as refugees, there's three options that are available to them.",

Salome Mwangi is a resident of Idaho’s Treasure Valley since 2004. She was born and raised in Kenya and relocated to the United States as a refugee with her daughter and the daughter’s father, who had fled his native Ethiopia, seeking refuge in Kenya, where they met, got married and started a family. As the Refugee Speakers Bureau coordinator at the Idaho Office for Refugees, she supports former refugees in crafting and sharing their stories in culturally appropriate ways in communities around the Treasure Valley and beyond.",
