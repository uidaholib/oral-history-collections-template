<p>Latah County was an exhilarating place to live at the beginning of the twentieth century. Residents of the county contended with <a href="#animals" >wild animals</a>, <a href="#lynching" >mob actions</a>, <a href="#Great Depression" >economic upheaval</a>, <a href="#murder" >revenge murders</a>, <a href="#iww" >union struggles</a>, <a href="#accidents" >mining and logging accidents</a>, and various other challenges in settling and inhabiting an area that had already long been inhabited by many <a href="#Native Americans" >Native Americans</a> who called the place home.</p>
<p>We present here digitized audio recordings together with their indexes and transcripts for over 300 detailed recollections of life during that time. These oral histories were first conducted and collected in the mid-1970s by the Latah County Historical Society. For more on the collection, check out Schrager's <a href="{{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}">new introduction to the material</a>, as well as the original foreword and guide.</p>
