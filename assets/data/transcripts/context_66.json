    "description": "Look at a U.S. map, and you’ll see the familiar cluster of states, plus Hawai'i and Alaska in boxes off to the side. But what about Puerto Rico? American Samoa? The U.S. has held overseas territories—home to millions of U.S. nationals—for most of its history. Though often absent from textbooks, these territories have been central to the nation’s past. This talk explores what U.S. history would look like if it included all U.S. land: the Greater United States. Bio: Daniel Immerwahr (IM-mer-var, he/him) is a history professor at Northwestern University specializing in global history and U.S. foreign relations. His first book, Thinking Small (Harvard, 2015), a history of U.S. grassroots antipoverty strategies, won the Organization of American Historians' Merle Curti Award for best work in U.S. intellectual history. His second, How to Hide an Empire, which reframes U.S. history to include its overseas territories, was a national bestseller and won the Robert Ferrell Book Prize from the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. Immerwahr is currently working on two research projects: one on the pop culture of U.S. global hegemony and another on nineteenth-century urban catastrophes. His writings have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, Slate, The Nation, and The New Republic.",
