Ernest Anderson,00;18;25;21,00;19;00;02,"No. During the years that I wrote about for Uncle, you see these there are a lot of logging. Men went to the woods in the wintertime, and as soon as they got spring camp, they would go down in the southern states and get job in the harvest, you know, and go around, see, And they always hit up their Moscow at about half time or about a week or so before.",recreation;economy;agriculture
Ernest Anderson,00;19;00;04,00;19;19;06,"And they get out and get a job for working hard, get a job for a farm to shock grain and he getting bored and he get some money.

Ernest Anderson,00;19;19;06,00;19;45;14,They didn't like it. It was so hot and hard getting dangerous and everything. So they had to be there in the wintertime and they were pretty much a follow up from year to year. But there were a lot of them just like them. Some people didn't stick around very long and sometimes some of them stayed. And I've got to get two or three guys.,
Ernest Anderson,00;19;45;14,00;20;20;13,"And if they didn't want to go back to something else right away where they see, they could go into Canada, too, you know, And I right there, and even until the snow came, you know, because it the snow was dry and all you had to do was they bound it then. Now the wind road with the wind roar they don't badly and that lays there and they can't get it right in the fall they'll get frightened spring and that's what they did.",

You don't go set easier a hot water and then a will in guru water set on your clothes you can't get them. White is all about getting no clothes and no really you know lukewarm water at the best.",
Ernest Anderson,01;05;16;04,01;05;54;24,"But you see, you live and learn and we get it out. We had it out on the line at 8:00 in the morning. We the first ones out. Let's go my sister and take them in. We got dry. They would freeze dry in winter under the porch. Him cold. They'd freeze dry, take long sometimes take him in stiff, throw them on to always had a bath on Saturday afternoon.",health
Ernest Anderson,01;05;54;27,01;06;29;19,"It was a rotation they used. You got it bath once a week and it was the same. We had one set of clothes we wore to school. Then we had to go into an overall and different shirt where wear clean clothes. I mean, we had our clean clothes on. The only had two shirts. So you see that the way we had to alternate and pull it like that.",
Ernest Anderson,01;06;29;22,01;07;12;17,"But dad, when I, I should get kind of shaggy and we go to school in them and you buys a new one, have to go to church, school or go somewhere else where we want to go. That's where you rotated with. We got a new pair of shoes every year that the oldest, the what would the best shoes to go to school in and the new ones we had use for it go in or go to church and we never missed church never once Sunday school all time we always had I was on the honor roll coming Sunday school.",clothing
Ernest Anderson,01;07;12;24,01;07;26;15,It never settling We ever missed it any time the school years seldom because we lived in town clothes we didn't have the problem people in the country had coming in.,
Sam Schrager,01;07;26;21,01;07;31;08,What do you remember from Sunday school? What it was like?,
Ernest Anderson,01;07;31;11,01;08;17;19,"Well, what I can say too much of that. I don't know really how much we learn. I think a lot of times we lived in fear more than anything else. Kids not really understand what they're trying to teach, and they're very strict about a lot of things. Your behavior, for example. And well, for an example, you sit like this, you sit and you look, you're going over there and over here you're looking around all over and you're paying attention.",conflict
Ernest Anderson,01;08;17;22,01;08;58;08,"The teachers, men, some of the were men, mostly men. And I can't remember my first very first years in Sunday school. I really can't. I seem like our life got on it. But everything was memorized, even from time we were small. I know because I every once in a while I'll pop up saying something that we remember a little, and I have some of my Sunday school books and I found one of my brothers and that he got when he started school, Sunday school in 1908.",
Ernest Anderson,01;08;58;10,01;09;40;25,"And that was a book from his teacher for four, being there all the time, you know, And I forgot who gave it to him. But it was a very nice book and I intended to read it, but it was written in English. No, this baffled me. So I called up the neighbor living up here at Clarence Johnson. He's 78 years old now, 76, maybe 77 or eight.",
Ernest Anderson,01;09;40;28,01;10;24;12,"And I said, when in the world, the Swedish Sunday School, because I know 1917, you could not preach Swedish. So school it good. It serves adults, but not young children. And so that's when it quit. Then I never went such projects in Troy anymore then for three years, because I wasn't home, I went to Moscow. I was confirmed the 26 to me in 1917.",swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;10;24;13,01;10;54;09,"I graduated in eighth grade, same year and we graduated. And they confirmed you around 15? They started well, I had gone two years, but I had learned the catechism and all that. I wish I could remember it. I wished I had learned it in English. But that's not to be thought of now. But I have a Swedish catechism now.",swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;10;54;09,01;11;11;15,"I button Sweden. I never did not gain my wife. And maybe later on, as I knew right away where it was, I'd go get it. I know where it is and read you some of it better you and understand it.",swedish
Sam Schrager,01;11;11;15,01;11;20;19,It can. Can you say more or is there more to say about about learning English in school where you mentioned it.,
Ernest Anderson,01;11;20;21,01;12;01;16,"You had to absolutely talk English when you came they wouldn't accept and you just strictly they had English teachers and and they wouldn't have a Swedish speaking person to school teaching. But they had good order, very strict order. And there were times that I think they were a little bit out of order, little bit too severe, it seemed to me to correct anything was a rule of the whip, you know, like everybody was getting bounced around home and they were all I know if kids would get it.",swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;12;01;22,01;12;28;18,"I knew I had more weapons than I earned for because all God blame for everything. And one thing I had against my sister a long time, she'd always tell that I started something. You know, I'll go, I think is one way getting it back on me somewhere or I don't know that I never hated her really, but I never liked the way she did it.",conflict
Ernest Anderson,01;12;28;20,01;12;35;17,And nothing was ever said about that After we grew older. Or you never talk about.,
Sam Schrager,01;12;35;19,01;12;41;11,"Why do you think that that this there was so much discipline? I mean, was there more Why was it so much?",
Ernest Anderson,01;12;41;12,01;13;12;15,"I don't know. It was a strict rule. No country I see right now. We were there in Sweden. Those kids are so well behaved and they don't beat them up. They say, no, no, and and they give a reason why you don't want to be like some dolt, some old dummy or something. You want to be polite, you want to not get mad.",swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;13;12;17,01;13;36;25,"It's things like that. They fight or nothing. They never liked it. But the children we met, they loved each other so much. You never seen the like. I thought that was one of the eye openers I hear. And that was one of the things. How did they stay with something? They had something that I had in there when I raised my kids.",
Ernest Anderson,01;13;36;27,01;13;55;05,"I didn't beat my kids around like that. I was pretty sound mind when I said that and I mean it. But, you know, I never tried to have to go through the same thing that I did I wouldn't at it did have to learn and understand what to do and not to do.",
Sam Schrager,01;13;55;08,01;14;07;01,When you were in school and you spoke better Swedish and in English when you started out I guess is that did did you have a real hard time understanding what was going on in a class?,swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;14;07;03,01;14;32;05,"Well, they get the meanings of everything was a little bit difficulty, I would say so, but we learned fast know you don't get it fast. And because I have no I know Norwegian family came late years and their oldest boy learned so quick and we did too. But I don't know.",norway;culture
Sam Schrager,01;14;32;08,01;14;36;20,Would you hear the words and get an English word in Swedish and then understand? No.,swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;14;36;23,01;15;13;19,"No, no. You just learn to read it and you learn spell it. The main thing was learned to read it. Both pronounced very much on it, very much. But you see, after you kids die, you mix and you're asked and you learn it pretty fast. It comes real fast. Got a new fella, Oscar Johnson. He came here when he was I think he was in third or fourth grade in school.",
Ernest Anderson,01;15;13;19,01;15;51;18,"And so in that school time, he came and I said, I say, Yeah, the school board. And the parents thought they should go. He should start in the first grade and go as fast as they could, pay no attention till they get up to where they should be, as they are capable of learning as a man. Don't get in here all the year and next year and all year and third grade and so on.",
Ernest Anderson,01;15;51;21,01;16;17;20,"If they can go in one year up to where they belong was in Sweden why, that's fine. So you get the age limit along with you, you know, and they came along real well. They were intelligent, too. And, you know, they that never left them. You know, they're learning. So we had to hang on to it. That's the way I had to do at home.",swedish
Ernest Anderson,01;16;17;20,01;16;47;15,"You know, I studied a lot after I went to bed, but then led everyone to go and boy, I'd say to fall asleep. My face is couldn't take it any longer. But in the morning at it, just everything was clear. Boy, if you got the will, I don't care to learn or to do something, you learn it, you know, But you got to have the will to do it.",health
Ernest Anderson,01;16;47;18,01;17;20;12,"I think so. Very much so. Have the students today take the interest in what they were trying to out of themselves. In a lot of other monkey business. They'd be better people too, I think, be determined. They were terribly determined a lot of the older one. Now, I had a mother teacher, she had several children. Mrs. McComb was her name, but she was so nice.",
Ernest Anderson,01;17;20;14,01;17;48;07,"She was one that was more the lovable type and she would come and help you, whereas you had some of the married teachers who were real cranks the way I felt about them. Anyway. And you were scared? Yeah. You would close up too much and you wouldn't get out of what you should have had to get it from somebody else.",
Ernest Anderson,01;17;48;09,01;18;18;02,"And this happened when one of my children went to school and she was a new teacher and they said he wouldn't get dumbed down, but he was something he couldn't get. So you get over them and he kept information and he did doll it down. He says, you're more intelligent than the rest of them, and I can't give you all my time, everybody.",
Ernest Anderson,01;18;18;04,01;18;48;26,"So much time. Well, even getting any he come home and cry and tell it mother. But he went down so it went I guess for quite a while till my wife, she wrote down, sent a note with him to school. He wouldn't tell me. I don't know why. And She figured it was her problem. She thought I wouldn't do anything about it.",
Ernest Anderson,01;18;48;29,01;19;15;10,"After all the years I've been on school board clerk of the district for years and years, he didn't want to have anything to do with it. So she thought she understood it better because she had gone through school up here and school hours were. It was pretty rough some time. Well, anyway, give it to the teacher and he left for home.",
Ernest Anderson,01;19;15;12,01;19;56;07,"He said, I want you to read it. And so he here afterwards, that evening at school, I guess he, went to the professor in the early the next morning, he called up here, my wife, and talked to her. I went home, I was in the field and he said, I think we got a little misunderstanding here. And he says, I want you to come down tonight after school, let out, come up in the office, and and we'll see what we can do about it.",agriculture
Ernest Anderson,01;19;56;09,01;20;29;10,"So I said, no, I took her down. She didn't know what to do, but I said, Well, you started now. You for once you end it. I said, You know everything about it. I haven't heard a thing. So I said, I'm not going to go in there and stir up any problem because I had to write one teacher in my time as a clerk in any country school, and I didn't want to start something else.",
Ernest Anderson,01;20;29;13,01;21;03;18,"So she did. But it worked out all right. And after that, he had no more problem. Not at all. So you see, I mean, if if you if you are neglected and my young daughter says the same thing, if you neglected child when he's down in the first and second grade, he won't get further up the line that he should have because what he's going to get, he's got to get it here and there.",
Ernest Anderson,01;21;03;18,01;21;32;13,"And then as you go step by step and if you don't get it in that those depth lines, you're going to miss up back here. My eighth grade schoolteachers told us he was one of the best teachers and he was a man teacher. He was from Scotland. And he said if they're not learned from one through three, we have to do it all over.",scotland
Ernest Anderson,01;21;32;13,01;22;10;23,"When they get to seventh and eighth grade, we had to go back and I guess he was right. My daughter said the same thing. So it's a lot it's not a mandatory thing so much that you want to put across. It's the love you have for them. And I think there's anything better than to show a child, prove to a child that you really love them and never let them get it.",
Ernest Anderson,01;22;10;23,01;22;38;27,"If they get angry with you, you still be good and don't show it because you in them. I had done the same thing when I taught them school and I found that out in in going to school that I was not getting what I should have gotten had I learned some other way. And they should have been able and capable of giving us that which we needed.",
Ernest Anderson,01;22;38;27,01;23;02;00,"We didn't get from our teachers. We had one teacher. I don't know if I should put it on a recording or not, but he thought I was doing something that I should be one day here. I wasn't doing anything but doing my lesson. But everybody in that room looked at me, you know, and then he began to laugh.",
Ernest Anderson,01;23;02;02,01;23;29;20,"And I guess I started to blush or something and couldn't figure it out. And he came walking down and it was the last period after he says, we had about 15 minutes of training for school, let out and he had papers to correct. And so I just said, do whatever you want to do, you behind on do that.",recreation;economy
Ernest Anderson,01;23;29;22,01;23;56;12,"And that's what I was doing. Now, drawing the map of United States and Britain, all the states, its occupations in it, you know, that we had learn about in you get bored and tired of sleeping in him down behind me. And he reached down in my shoulder and pulled me up, you know, and I would sit in my legs this way and he came up single seat.",
Ernest Anderson,01;23;56;14,01;24;19;28,"It was a double seat, but it was cut metal. And I come right with it because I had seen her do that before to some other kids. For some reason I didn't know. And she was strong and she was hot, very hot tempered. And when I come up, I come under John back in my hair, not intensely. I don't know.",
Ernest Anderson,01;24;20;01,01;24;48;14,"I just run like a spring trapped. And I heard her teeth there and her teeth were in this way like that and can feel a lot of gold and stuff. And I think I broke one tooth. I felt that and wrote that. He never bothered me. After that, you never did ask me why, and I never found out what you came back for.",
Ernest Anderson,01;24;48;16,01;25;02;28,"I had done. But as I think it all right up over here, how did it come in? I don't know. But He he brought it on himself. I didn't bring it on her. So he I felt.",
Sam Schrager,01;25;03;01,01;25;16;05,"When you say that you quit school here in grade and you said before, sort of part of it was the problems with other kids. It wasn't worth it with the with the kids in town. Was that the main reason why you you.",
Ernest Anderson,01;25;16;07,01;25;45;08,"Yeah I tell you, it was I never was happy I couldn't go out and play again because the kids always try to pick fights, you know, But one kid on to you and neither one I was going to fight with them. All high school kids, you know, they like to see two roosters fight that way. They they would like it, you know, like you take two roosters and put them together, especially to bat eight or so and that's the way they.",recreation
Ernest Anderson,01;25;45;16,01;26;01;27,"they enjoyed that old time and the daylight, you know, get kids to fight and then they make one hit the other one. And not only me, but it was all through school, high school. I would do that. Some of them boys will.",
Sam Schrager,01;26;01;27,01;26;09;02,"Do you think you said there is a difference between the city, between the town there and and kids in the country and the country?",
Ernest Anderson,01;26;09;05,01;26;46;15,"Well, the country school, I don't know. They I never went to one, but I was clerk for one for many years. Three different districts as we were. But I don't know we never had any problems. And teachers got along fine country schools where they had eight classes some years and they actually come better educated than the city kids were when it came to final examination.",
Ernest Anderson,01;26;46;15,01;27;10;16,"They took all the highest grades all the time around here and they took out the kids from the country were more intelligent and got better grades and anybody else did. No one in the city of Troy I know, and very few in Moscow that ever out them. I'd be any kid from school out the country going to school in town.",
Sam Schrager,01;27;10;18,01;27;13;08,Are you telling me about their real early days or when you were?,
Ernest Anderson,01;27;13;10,01;28;00;25,"Well, this is when I was a kid. Yeah, I don't know. No. You see, so many of the years I was learned I wasn't too long before the consolidated to town. Let's see, I was 38 years on Driscoll Ridge, and then after a couple of years, we moved back here. All the license plates. I think I was clerk for about three or four years, and I wanted to then the some of the school district had to give up because we didn't have children enough.",
Ernest Anderson,01;28;00;25,01;28;42;22,"We couldn't have a teacher, not that they couldn't pay tax, but there wasn't justification to have a teacher with three or four children. And so then they had bus to town to try. This was temporary to start with. Then in later years, one too many years I must been in about 40. Yes, 44. My oldest daughter got married and I had quit the year before up here because I wanted to move to town with the kids.",
Ernest Anderson,01;28;42;22,01;29;09;08,"The town, bus them to town rather than to have to like they had done in the past. Either they had to stay in town. I had one girl went through high school. She was in town two years and that was no good for her. So I let it dry, then come home. We had three miles a little better in the car, down and back and forth.",
Ernest Anderson,01;29;09;10,01;29;35;15,"If I needed, I'd have to take her down in the morning and take some of the neighbor with same time going to high school. It was just a high school kid, but we had a quite a time over that. But at the same time I felt it was the thing that we had to do and it would we'd be better for the families, the kids too.",
Ernest Anderson,01;29;35;18,01;30;07;05,"And then they had to stand down or somewhat back and forth. So we finally got a couple my my stay, not my my time to go out. Anyway, three years was the fourth year. I wouldn't go back. And then they come down the following year and then and they begged me, Don't go back. If you don't come back, we'll have to haul our own kids all that time and said that we don't want to do land.",
Ernest Anderson,01;30;07;05,01;30;36;10,Got down with busy time to Harlan so we got all it was hard to get a school but during the war you know terrible I we found one down to the southern part of the southern part of the state right on Twin Falls.

Ernest Anderson,01;30;36;12,01;31;08;12,"So I said, I'm going to do a little psychology work. And then people on Sunday for school started.

We had plenty of money in this district, so we didn't have any trouble. See, we got railroad tax money to kind of the railroad GoDaddy, so we used nearby. We always had plenty of money so we could play schoolteachers better salaries too.",recreation

And I think the when we went in then decided to go, then they took all the books and everything they wanted out of the their desks or anything.",
Ernest Anderson,01;32;40;29,01;32;53;21,"And then after it was permanent, they consolidated the district with the it was a consolidated city. Then we built for that. We sold the building and I don't remember where the money went to.",
