Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:32:21:00],00:32:26:23,Narrator George Takei to kind of fill in those gaps.,
Doug Exton,[00:32:27:00],00:32:48:07,"I do also want to say we are now accepting questions for the Q&A, and we already have one. And the question is where the people held in American concentration camps, given any reparations or resettlement support once they're allowed to return to their homes? And how many were deported to Japan or other Asian countries?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:32:48:09],00:33:10:15,"Yeah. So, I guess the support that was provided was, $25 and a one way ticket. There was some, so the whole program of resettlement was kind of orchestrated by the government to break up the Japanese American population off the West Coast. So originally people couldn't go back to the west Coast that they had to move inland.",migration
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:33:10:17],00:33:32:10,"And, but I think, a majority of the Japanese-American population, ended up going back to the West Coast, because a lot of folks had trouble, trying to, you know, try to fit into the communities, whether it was like Chicago or Denver. And they some folks had a really hard time. So they're like, you know what?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:33:32:10],00:33:49:08,"I'd rather try to make make our way back to what we called home to see if that's going to be better than where they ended up, resettling at. As with, I think the last question, can I get that clarified? Was it, how many people were deported? Was that the question there?",
Doug Exton,[00:33:49:10],00:33:54:12,Let me see. Yeah. How many were deported to Japan or other Asian countries?,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:33:54:14],00:34:02:09,"Yeah. So it would have been to Japan, and I believe the number is about 4600 ish or so.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:34:03:24],00:34:30:04,"Other folks who were deported, to Japan and it was kind of through, a voluntary aspect in one capacity where people could just say, you know what? I, you know, I choose to go, to go to Japan. Not everyone actually have been to Japan sometimes are following their families. If their mom and dad was like, hey, let's try to see if we can make it better over there.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:34:30:04],00:34:51:24,"Let's, you know, go through this process of repatriating. So there's kind of a misnomer because some people think like, oh, they're going back to Japan. But for most of the people, it was their first time going, because if their children, there were some people who were then, used kind of for a prisoner exchange as well, where they're going down to Crystal City.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:34:51:24],00:35:25:05,"And then, they were used that way. I'm not sure if any Japanese-Americans were used in that capacity. We have documented evidence, of Japanese Latinos that the government, actually kidnapped people from Latin America, brought them up to the United States, and then used them as POW exchange, which, actually caused a kerfuffle within, the rules of engagement, because most of the time when you do POW exchange a soldier for soldier, and then Imperial Japan was like, why are there women and children and why are they speaking Spanish?",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:35:25:07],00:35:52:07,"So that's when, they had the Spanish Red Cross actually intervene. And then it was determined that, oh, this is what the United States is doing to their American citizens. And, Japanese citizens for that, you say, who were barred by law from becoming, naturalized citizens. And so, that's when Imperial Japan started to find out more about what was happening to their citizens and their descendants, which, and oral histories.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:35:52:07],00:36:15:21,"We we've heard this a lot where, at one point in time, Imperial Japan was actually sending provisions to the United States, to help offset food, issues with Japanese Americans at these sites. So you'll hear oral histories where people are like, wow, we got, giant bats, assure you, which is, soy sauce. And we actually have in our collection from the Japanese Red cross tea bags.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:36:15:21],00:36:38:02,"So they're sending teeth over to try to provide, some supplement supplements, for the food issues out here, because we did have issues specifically at Minidoka where there wasn't good quality food, at first. And then people had to petition to actually, have ethnically appropriate food.",
Doug Exton,[00:36:38:03],00:36:55:09,"And then how many of these people were able to start their lives back to what it was once they were, out of the camps and everything kind of started to return, honestly, back to normal. But once the camp for those in that process was finished.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:36:55:11],00:37:20:00,"Yeah. So that's a little harder to answer because, we didn't really do a whole bunch of, data gathering as a government on that. There's there were a couple of sociological studies that was done, after the war in the 40s. But, it's kind of hard to just gauge to say like X amount of people, you know, we're able to kind of restart their lives, I guess everyone in some capacity had to.",culture;conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:37:20:00],00:37:44:24,"But I think their quality of life, was definitely not the same as pre-war. There was a lot of people who lost their properties because, they didn't make enough, of a wage and camp to pay their mortgages or their property taxes. And a lot of property was lost during that time. Personally, my family was incarcerated at Manzanar in California, and we were a fishing family.",economy
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:37:44:24],00:38:10:01,"So two of our, family boats got repossessed, and we never, ever went back into the fishing industry after war. So a lot of folks, especially if they were in professional jobs, whether they're teachers or doctors, it was really hard for them to go back into those fields because of the racism that existed. So like my grandfather, he was actually drafted out of Manzanar into the military.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:38:10:01],00:38:36:06,"So he was in the military intelligence service. And when he came back from war, he was unable to actually secure a job because no one wants to hire and they use a derogatory terms of Japs. And so he couldn't find a job. So he was like, you know what? I'll be my own boss. So he decided that, he wanted to be a door to door salesman, but he still faced, racism, where people didn't want to buy from a Japanese-American.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:38:36:06],00:39:01:00,"And so he ended up, becoming a professional wrestler by putting his pride aside because people needed an enemy to fight. So there was actually this whole generation of Nisei wrestlers, who a lot of them were vets that had to do very much stereotypical Japanese things to, you know, create this, you know, this narrative of, you know, fighting and whatnot.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:39:01:02],00:39:25:02,"And that's how he was able to support his family. And so, a lot of folks, it was a struggle for them because, you know, they not everyone was able to go back to, their regular profession or even go back to the same city that they came out of, let alone their homes. But there were a few stories where people were able to still get their homes back because they had friends watching it.",economy
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:39:25:04],00:39:28:14,But that's really few and far between.,
Doug Exton,[00:39:28:16],00:39:35:02,"And how were the, conditions at the other camps outside of the Minidoka camp?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:39:35:04],00:40:09:02,"So, some of them were the same. Some of them were worse. So Minidoka was kind of pegged as one of the more positive viewed camps. It's because the administration, with the white administration, that relationship, between Harry, all staff, Stafford and the incarcerated was actually pretty good originally when Harry L Stafford, joined to become an administrator of the camp, he wanted to be part of the war effort because he was too old to go into the military.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:40:09:04],00:40:33:06,"But then once he got here, he realized, hey, this is kind of messed up. And even in his journals, he said, the worst thing about the camp was that it was operational. So he tried it, with the best within the realm of his bureaucracy, to try to be as communicative and trying to provide as much, comfort as he could as a bureaucrat.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:40:33:06],00:41:00:21,"So it wasn't like he could let them go or anything like that. But, you know, eventually he established day passes where, incarcerated could get permission to go into twin Falls for the day. So that became kind of a highlight for people who are getting married. So because a lot of people didn't want their marriage license to, say, Hunt Idaho, so they would go into town to get married, of the I mentioned that incarcerated petition to grow ethnically appropriate vegetables.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:41:01:02],00:41:33:05,"He allowed that. So we actually had a tofu factory on site. They were able to grow, gobo and some daikon radishes, that are ethnically appropriate. And then the War Relocation Authority ended up becoming the largest purchaser of rice during the war, to help, feed folks. So I think with that aspect, Minidoka has a more positive view compared to the some of the other camps, because Tule Lake ended up becoming a segregation center, and five federal agencies went in to oversee that.",labor;conflict;migration
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:41:33:07],00:41:56:12,"So that became this, huge issue where there was a lot of suppression of people's rights, at that site. And I was, you know, also like pegged as, like the bad camp to be at which I use air quotes because it was at first another War Relocation Authority site, just like Minidoka, but ended up converting into a maximum security prison.",conflict;migration
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:41:56:14],00:42:09:24,"And then you have, like, Manzanar there, riots down there. There are riots at some of the other camps as well. So, so Minidoka tends to have one of the more positive views in comparison.",
Doug Exton,[00:42:10:01],00:42:18:21,"And then out of all the people incarcerated at Minidoka, how many of them stayed in Twin Falls or Idaho? Greater area.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:42:18:23],00:42:44:22,"Yeah. So, they're very, very few people that ended up staying in the area. I don't know an exact number, but I only know of one, I think 2 or 3 families, that are here that had families who are incarcerated, at Minidoka. But I don't think that they just moved out afterwards. I think eventually, over time, they ended up coming back to Twin Falls.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:42:44:24],00:43:07:20,"But the one thing that's also interesting is that there are Japanese-Americans living in Twin Falls in Jerome, Idaho, who were not in cars related because they're beyond the exclusion zone. So we also have a large population in Idaho Falls as well. So they don't have a connection to Minidoka because they're beyond, that zone. So so there's a variety of stories of this.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:43:07:20],00:43:12:06,"There's so many layers, and I don't want to go into all these rabbit holes.",
Doug Exton,[00:43:12:08],00:43:19:12,And then I would assume that you have documentation of every prisoner having a.... Is that correct?,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:43:19:14],00:43:38:19,"So we don't actually have, all the documentation, but the government did document a lot of this. And as of right now, they're over at the National Archives. And so far, you know, we were not able to get access to all of them, because if people are still alive, we have to get permission because it is personal information.",
Unknown Speaker,[00:43:38:19],00:43:39:08,Right?,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:43:39:10],00:44:07:20,"So, over time, we'll be able to get access. To a majority of the documents. We pulled some files here and there as we're doing some research. But it was highly documented on this whole program and just a little caveat I need to mention is that the Department of Interior was actually in charge of the War Relocation Authority, and I now work for the National Park Service, which is, managed by the Department of Interior.",education;migration
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:44:07:20],00:44:33:09,"So this is the government almost coming full circle, recognizing that, hey, we messed up. We need to talk about the civil liberties and civil rights issues. And that's why it was significant resources. It was determined that there's enough resources here to tell this story. And that's why Minidoka, Manzanar or Tule Lake, Honolulu, really, have been established as national park units to tell this story.",
Doug Exton,[00:44:33:11],00:44:38:07,And then where there are any documented beatings or homicides within the camps specifically.,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:44:39:17],00:45:02:07,"So, yeah. So I know that there's probably, all of that, there. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to look at the records because the National Archives originally had them available, but then because of the personal information, they ended up, kind of, removing them from the general circulation. So we haven't been able to actually gather all that information.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:45:02:13],00:45:25:06,"I do know that I believe those about, like, 300 deaths, on site and there were suicides. There were a lot of those, really, you know, tough subjects of folks like, we just, so we're doing an online pilgrimage right now. That's been nine weeks to talk about the incarceration. So if you Google Japanese-American memorial pilgrimages, you'll find it.",migration
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:45:25:08],00:45:50:24,"But, we had this, elder panel session a few weekends ago where we had, I want to say was 3 or 4 Minidoka survivors and one of the, woman. She just realized that one of her, I think, was her neighbor or someone she knew committed suicide in camp and used, rocks to hold herself down. Which is, you know, that was the first time that she was talking about it.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:45:50:24],00:46:12:02,"So her family was really shocked to hear that. So. So I know it made an impact, for people who heard about these, these incidents. So, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a homicide or not. So. But I just I don't have, documentation to back it up, but knowing, you know, you're basically building a city, right?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:46:12:08],00:46:32:17,"And you're going to have real city issues, you know, interpersonal conflicts, because most of these folks, you know, they're coming in from urban areas. They had their own homes and then yet they're shoved into this communal lifestyle, which is really, unusual for them because they have privacy, you know, when they were at home here, you have no privacy.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:46:32:17],00:47:02:10,"You had to share, you know, the bathrooms and the toilets. You don't have, that space for yourself, you know, and I love my family, but I don't think I could share a 20 by 20 space with them. You know, I could sometimes with my siblings, I could only, like, be around each other for like, 40 minutes. So it caused a lot of, issues psychologically, too, because of this new environment that people are trying to adjust to, which, was unusual for a lot of the folks that were coming in.",
Doug Exton,[00:47:05:05],00:47:22:07,"And then in the video they mentioned with the survey, if you said no, joining the military, you were sent to prison so that the official like apologies from the presidents, did not acknowledge the specific people that were imprisoned for not being willing to join the military.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:47:22:09],00:47:49:20,"Yeah. So I don't think it was specifically noted in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. The community has done some, some comments on that. But to clarify, it wasn't if they said no on the questionnaire that they're incarcerated, but they said no on the questionnaire. They were segregated to like the maximum security prison. But if they were drafted and did not go to induction, then they were charged with draft evasion and then incarcerated.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:47:49:22],00:48:19:22,"So, so, yeah. So, one of my friends, Takashi Zaki, I serve on a board with him who was 17 years old, and he was over at Heart Mountain in Wyoming, and he actually resisted the draft, and he was sent to, to federal prison for, I think, a year and a half or two years. And, when I was talking to him one time, he said that he felt really bad for his parents because knowing that the conditions in camp at, you know, there's no privacy.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:48:19:22],00:48:41:14,"You know, the housing was terrible, the food was terrible. He said that when he was in, at McNeil Island, he had better access to health care. He had privacy with his own indoor plumbing. He had better access to better quality food. You know, for other leisurely things like a library and, you know, whatnot.",education
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:48:41:20],00:49:10:00,"So he said that, you know, he felt really bad because of that, but, you know, it wasn't until I want to say, well, I don't know what the year, but they did overturn a lot of those convictions. So it wasn't a felony, even though they still served their time for draft resistance because the government recognized, you know, hey, you know, they're trying to, protest, you know, their civil liberties and civil rights because the whole point of it was like, hey, give me back my civil liberties.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:49:10:00],00:49:31:00,"Civil rights, take us out of this prison, and then we'll go into the military. But until then, you can pick and choose and say, we're American citizens to draft us, but not treat us as American citizens. And so, you know, to Takashi Hanna, he is a war vet. So he did fight in the Korean War because when he got drafted, he's like, I have my civil liberties intact.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:49:31:06],00:49:34:17,It is my duty to go so and think.,
Doug Exton,[00:49:34:19],00:49:48:23,"That brought up a really good point about the quality of life and putting it into perspective where, you know, it's you got a better quality of life being in an actual prison than in these camps themselves.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:49:49:00],00:50:20:18,"Yeah. And the other aspect is here's another data point to compare it to. So there was a POW camp nearby in  where they actually held German POW who were caught on the front line holding arms against the United States. And they were brought out here to work in the fields. So as a POW who actually fought against the United States citizens, they had more, opportunities of freedom where under the Geneva Convention, they actually had better access to healthcare, food and certain amenities.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:50:20:23],00:50:41:10,"So they weren't behind the barbed wire. A lot of them integrated within the community itself, out in Rupert. And, they could stay overnight if they got permission at the farmer's house. But if they're in groups of ten or more, then they were escorted by a military. But other than that, you know, they had more freedom and leisure.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:50:41:12],00:51:07:06,"At Minidoka, they were, surrounded by barbed wire, those military police unit watching all their movement, if they're, you know, coming in or out, if they have permission to actually leave. A lot of the returning vets of the Nisei vets who were incarcerated went off to war. They're coming back for their R&R once they pass that imaginary line there to another inmate rather than another, you know, military personnel.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:51:07:08],00:51:26:17,"And so those are the differences where even, you know, we have this image, for Christmas 1944, their kids eating hot dogs. And some people, when they see that, they're like, oh, that's cute. You know, they're trying to be un-American, eating hot dogs, which is like, they're actually Americans. And why are they eating hot dogs for Christmas?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:51:26:19],00:51:51:15,"Then? You see, and the reports were the German actually got a proper ham dinner, with all the fixings, you know, and it's like, hey, why is there a disparity here where American citizens only got like, you know, basically hot dogs and then POW actually got a real Christmas meal. So you could kind of then see, you know, how how that differs.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:51:51:15],00:52:30:06,"And it's, you know, it doesn't make us feel good, right? As whether we're the government or people just hearing these stories. But we need to recognize that we did treat people really differently, you know, and the whole point of, or at least the government at the time was trying to say there military necessity to do this, you know, but it's like, is there really military necessity when the FBI, the Office of Naval Intelligence said that there's no need to do this, and then why are we actually treating people who fought against the United States better, you know, than Japanese Americans, American citizens who are here and were not convicted of anything, but yet they're",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:52:30:06],00:52:31:00,imprisoned.,
Unknown Speaker,[00:52:31:02],00:52:35:09,"So, yeah. Sorry.",
Doug Exton,[00:52:35:11],00:52:47:18,And then how did the community surrounding the camps respond to the sudden Japanese-American presence and that militaristic culture? I don't know. That appeared out of nowhere.,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:52:47:20],00:52:54:11,Yeah. I think at first there was some hesitation because a lot of the fear and war hysteria that existed.,conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:52:55:01],00:53:24:24,"And it didn't help that governor Chase Clark was very anti-Japanese. You know, he used a derogatory term of Japanese. And he did say that they were going to come into the state of Idaho. He wants them in a concentration camp with guns pointing inward. And so, and so I think because of all that racial hostility and then, the war hysteria that, you know, people were very concerned for their safety, not understanding that they're American citizens.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:53:24:24],00:53:45:07,"Because, you know, I was telling you about the POW camp nearby. A lot of people assume that these are Imperial Japanese soldiers who are brought in from the war front, not recognizing that they're civilians. Then eventually what the, harvest and whatnot. A lot of the young white men were, drafted into the war. So it created a labor shortage.",conflict;agriculture
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:53:45:11],00:54:09:20,"So they're utilizing Japanese Americans to fill in that labor shortage. And I think that that's where a lot of the community building began, because they're like, oh, these people are just in a really bad situation, but they're helping us out, helping us agriculturally. So we could still save the crops. Amalgamated Sugar actually put in an advertisement thanking the Japanese American community for the harvest.",agriculture
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:54:09:22],00:54:20:15,"So I think by the end of war, there was more of an openness and a, you know, an appreciation, than at the beginning of the war where there was that hesitation and concern.",conflict
Doug Exton,[00:54:21:24],00:54:43:16,"And then, is there any evidence of speaking of the agricultural workers, is there any evidence of individuals that were part of that agricultural, like movement, I guess, transitioning into later, labor movements in U.S. history after World War two?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:54:43:18],00:55:11:15,"Yeah. So I think that there is a correlation, because a lot of people who came well, so most of the folks that came, came to Minidoka was from Seattle and Portland area. So Washington and Oregon, but there are a whole group of people from Central California that were incarcerated. They went to other camps, but, so there was a whole bunch of farmers, you know, who who participated in kind of the war effort through agriculture and afterwards.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:55:11:15],00:55:40:24,"And it's been documented and, Asian American series that was on PBS that, that kind of helped with some of the, labor movement. But I don't necessarily think it was like Japanese, like Japanese-Americans or whatnot. A lot of it was with the Pinoy. But I think it's all kind of, mixed in there where, I do believe that there's probably some influences there since, you know, they were moved from south central California and, and, a lot of them did return back.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:55:41:01],00:55:44:05,So sorry. There's not a clear cut answer to that one.,
Doug Exton,[00:55:45:12],00:55:48:21,And is there a cemetery I'm going to do path.,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:55:48:23],00:56:10:01,"Yeah. So there was a cemetery at Minidoka. And yeah, I think we had I want to say it was like 300 people or so who passed away. It was definitely under 500. And so a lot of people, tried to cremate their family members if they did pass, because that is, kind of a Buddhist ritual.",religion
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:56:10:07],00:56:33:08,"So there was no crematories, in Idaho at the time. So they had to send remains down to, Utah for a cremation. But then they did have some of burials over there as well. But since it was Bureau of Reclamation land, most of the remains, were exhumed by the family and taken back to wherever they resettled after war.",conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:56:33:10],00:56:39:16,But the remaining remains was moved into a local cemetery.,
Doug Exton,[00:56:39:18],00:56:55:03,"And we are running short on time. But we do have a lot of questions still, so we'll try and power through them. Do you have any examples of communities that were accepting of the incarcerated Japanese-Americans after being incarcerated ended?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:56:55:05],00:57:14:23,"Yeah. So Bainbridge Island community was probably one of the more positive, reception back. And we do actually have a park film on that because Bainbridge Island is actually a unit of Minidoka. So, so I don't know if that's available online or not to check, but, but yeah, that was one of the more welcoming communities. Come back.",cinema
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:57:14:23],00:57:26:01,"There are pockets elsewhere, that, you know, welcomed family back. But it was just few. And far between because I think a majority of the folks, you know, they faced a lot of hostilities.",
Doug Exton,[00:57:26:22],00:57:30:10,Is Minidoka open currently during Covid?,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:57:30:12],00:57:55:02,"Yeah. So the trail itself is open. So you could come in seven days a week to walk a walk that it's a 1.6 mile trail. Unfortunately the visitor center itself is not open quite yet. We're hoping so. It's not, official yet, but we're hoping to open up over, Labor Day weekend. But we're waiting for, some issues to get resolved because basically, we have a water tank issue.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:57:55:02],00:58:05:01,"We don't have running water. So until we get that resolved, then we can open up the visitor center. But we're we're hopeful that it will be over Labor Day weekend. So check our website, to see.",

Doug Exton,[00:58:07:16],00:58:22:00,"And then, see what the video mentioned. The internee who is in prison for not joining the military, as we talked about earlier. Do you know exactly what happened to that internee specifically?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:58:22:02],00:58:28:17,"Maybe they're talking about Jay Akutsu? Seem, because was it the the vague comment about, like, then he was sent to the prison?",
Doug Exton,[00:58:28:23],00:58:29:15,Yes.,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:58:29:17],00:58:51:24,"Oh, okay. So that's with, Okay. So that's with, Fujiko. So, yeah, she doesn't really name the individual, but I'm pretty sure she was referring to the cases where, he was sent to McNeil, prison. I think that he was incarcerated there for a year and a half or two years as well. So. Yeah. And then, yeah.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:58:52:02],00:59:18:02,"So as both it was Jean and Jim. So I think that they're brothers who are both resisters because, at Minidoka, we had 40 resisters. And the one thing that was kind of weird is that I was telling you guys about governor Chase Clark and how he was anti Japanese. So by the time with the whole draft resister issue came up, he was actually the Idaho Supreme Court justice and didn't recuse himself during all the trials.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:59:18:04],00:59:29:17,"And, so that was another weird layer where he knowingly wanted the incarceration. And then, yeah, he convicted 37 of the young men, to prison.",
Doug Exton,[00:59:29:19],00:59:37:00,So and then is the road to Minidoka clearly marked with signs? And is it paved all the way?,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[00:59:37:02],01:00:01:17,"Yeah. So, no, it's not clear clearly, Mark, yet we're trying to work with Idaho Transportation Department, and it takes a while for that to get all process. But if you just, like, put in Google, Hunt Idaho or Minidoka National Historic Site, Google will bring you out to us. But make sure you're not clicking Minidoka Wildlife Refuge because that will take you about an hour away.",environment
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:00:01:19],01:00:19:09,"So but yes, most of the road itself, it's all paved. They'll go on, basically a highway and then a county road. Once you get to the site, you know, it's going to be all paved, at least to get to the visitor center parking area. We have a paid parking lot over by the guard tower.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:00:19:11],01:00:29:02,"But yeah. So it isn't like you're going to have to off road only if you take some of the service roads. That's where they're just. That's more like a trail. But it's, you know, please stay on the.",
Unknown Speaker,[01:00:29:02],01:00:31:17,Road for your own safety.,
Doug Exton,[01:00:31:19],01:00:39:06,"And then do you mind commenting on the recent book ""An Eye for Justice"", edited by Susan Stacy, if you're familiar with it?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:00:39:08],01:01:00:15,"Yeah. So, so I actually kind of helped tangentially on that book. So, Roberts's Sims, he was a professor over at Boise State University. He was actually the former dean of the College of Social Science and Public Affairs. But he was known as a preeminent scholar on Minidoka, and he passed away several years ago.",boise
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:01:00:17],01:01:22:22,"And so I was working, with his wife and with Stacy, to kind of gather, some of his writings. And Stacy did a really good job to edit it together. And then put, put some of his information out there. So all of Doctor Sims paperwork, and research is actually over at the Boise State University Special Collections.",education;boise
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:01:22:24],01:01:42:06,"And it's a great resource, which I'm sure there's going to be tons of additional research based off of all his research. But that was a way for us to kind of honor all of the work that he's done, but then also providing kind of, some information to the general public, potential things that people could research on.",education
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:01:42:06],01:01:49:04,"So it's a it's both kind of a book to talk about Minidoka, but it's also a resource guide as well.",
Doug Exton,[01:01:49:06],01:01:56:21,"And then do you, mind sharing other books and films and other resource materials on Minidoka?",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:01:56:23],01:02:12:12,"Yeah. So, you know, we have our Park film, so a couple books that I think are good to read. Tetsuden Kashima. And I'm like, actually blanking on the book theme. Hold on. Like, and I'm looking for.",cinema;literature
Unknown Speaker,[01:02:12:12],01:02:14:08,The book right now.,
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:02:14:10],01:02:36:23,"Oh, yeah. ""Personal Justice Denied"". Oh my gosh. And then there's, on the National Archives. We also have, you could just like, Google it, but, it's called it's a civilian, wartime internment, relocation from citizens or something like that. So this is CWI, RC, which is actually the congressional study that said this was due to war.",migration;education;conflict
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:02:37:00],01:02:55:22,"Yeah, war hysteria, race prejudice and a failure of political leadership that led to the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. So that's a government commission, a congressional commission that said we need to make an official apology. And they did research on that. So that's a really good resource as well as the book, to kind of focus on it.",conflict;education
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:02:55:24],01:03:21:17,"But it's going to be maybe a little bit more dense, because it is very, research related. But then there's other books, like if you like, fiction, like ""Hotel on the Corner"", ""Bitter and Sweet"" talks about, Minidoka a little bit, and the love story aspects. And, you know, another one is, ""Looking After Minidoka"", by Neil Nakadate.",education;literature
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:03:21:19],01:03:44:10,"And then Monica. Monica, Soren, wrote Nisei Daughter, which is another good book. So, yeah. So there's a lot of resources out there. Also then show is a really good resource as well, denture.org, where they have a lot of primary resources. And a lot of oral histories. And then check out the Japanese American Memorial pilgrimages as well.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:03:44:12],01:04:03:10,"Because we have a whole bunch of resources there, almost nine weeks of content, of oral histories covering all the camps. So it isn't just Minidoka. There was, you know, over 50 associated sites that incarcerated people. We have Department of Justice sites, Department of Army sites, all these little facilities that, you know, we talk about.",
Doug Exton,[01:04:03:10],01:04:14:22,"So and then unfortunately, this will be our last question you were able to get to tonight. But is the film that was shown here available for private screening.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:04:14:24],01:04:42:16,"You can purchase it online through Discover Your Northwest. And yeah, they have it available for sale. I'm not sure the cost of it or anything. I could try to throw it up in the chat so you could have that there. Let me try to find it. Okay. So I'll do that really quick. So here's that.",
Hanako Wakatsuki,[01:04:42:18],01:04:43:24,So yeah.,
Doug Exton,[01:04:44:01],01:05:05:04,"And then when this video gets posted on our website, I'll have that link also in the description box. So that way anyone can go and purchase it that way. But thank you both Hanako and everyone that came tonight and have a great night everyone.",
