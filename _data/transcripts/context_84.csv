Doug Exton,[00:00:00:00],00:00:24:19,"And thank you so much for joining us for tonight's Connected Conversation. A program conducted by the Idaho Humanities Council. If you're not familiar with our organization, I encourage you to check out our website, Idaho Humanities, Dawg. I'd like to remind amusement any questions using the Q&A feature located at the bottom of the screen. I cannot guarantee that any questions answered in the chat will be answered.",
Doug Exton,[00:00:24:21],00:00:33:06,"With me tonight is Doctor Erik Hadley from Boise State University, and it's an honor to have you with us tonight. I turn it over to you.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:00:33:08],00:01:01:02,"Thank you. Doug. It's a pleasure to be here. I do have a present--Google slide presentation that I can. You gave me sharing rights. I believe. Well, thank you, Doug, and thank you very many's council for inviting me. My name is Doctor Erik Hadley. I teach a variety of classes and history department of Boise State University, including classes, in European history, which is my specialty.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:01:01:12],00:01:33:06,"To be honest, but one of my PhD fields was in, a new field in the late 90s, early 2000s called the Atlantic World, which we moved away from national histories and look more regionally, and have continents and continent wide histories and environmental histories and, and the role of indigenous peoples, and particularly the role of agency and power of indigenous peoples, in, in it over long periods of time, 4 or 500 years.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:01:33:10],00:02:20:11,"And often starting with that, we would look before, you know, we have these key dates like Columbus sailing, 1492. And then somehow the narrative starts there on up in the Pacific in Hawaii, Captain Cook. And in 1788. And so the goal there was to move the narrative onto, indigenous ground and start with that. And then, yes, we we have this, this larger story of, eventually Western European settler colonial intervention, but to not grant power to that exclusively and say and move this notion of the age of discovery and put quotations around it and say, maybe an age of encounter is a better term.",literature;indigenous;migration;history;education
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:02:21:09],00:02:46:10,"Anyway, I, I've taught at a for a number of years and I got really interested in, in Pacific world and, Pacific Islander histories, particularly in Hawaii as well. And, so this is a challenge for me. This is my newest field, both, teaching at Boise State and as, in, emerging research interest for myself, which is when I teach a class called The Pacific World, at Boise State.",boise;education
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:02:46:10],00:03:18:08,"And it centers more or less on Hawaii. As, as, a micro history of, of it of an indigenous Pacific people with a very, particular special history and also, how their history tells us stories, a wider narrative, a wider kind of meta narrative of, of Pacific World. Identity. So that's where this started. And this talk is kind of the, I guess, the confluence of both of these, both Atlantic and Pacific world.",indigenous;literature
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:03:20:01],00:03:59:19,"I wanted to talk about the power of indigenous peoples, in resisting the settler colonial narrative, and hegemony. And, I do that both kind of. And I'm as guilty, I guess, even though the things that Atlantic and Pacific, I didn't put into a world theory perspective and, I kept stumbling onto notions where I would see different indigenous groups working together for the same goal, for the same, and, and, so when I was asked if I would be interested in doing a presentation for the IJC, I thought, I want to talk about something I've never actually presented, before.",indigenous;migration;history;literature
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:03:59:21],00:04:28:16,"So this is a new thing for me, and that is the intersections of where American Indian and, Native Hawaiian, movements over land and sovereignty in the last 50 years have met these kind of confluences, and it's not always going to be in the same direction. They're not always necessarily working to the same goals. But but, they're definitely operating in conjunction with one another and lifting each other up.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:04:28:18],00:04:49:24,"And, so that's what I want to talk about. I will say at the outset, I think it's important to note I'm not Native Hawaiian, and I have no claim to speak for Native Hawaiians. I have a deep respect for, Native Hawaiian culture, but I speak as an outsider and, so yeah, let's get started.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:04:50:01],00:05:16:07,"So I'm gonna start here and bring this to Idaho. This is doctor LaNada War Jack. She's a member of the shamanic tribe, out of Fort Hall in eastern Idaho. And this is a picture of her at Alcatraz in 1970. She's at Alcatraz because she was a, a group of of American Indian activists that occupied Alcatraz, the previous November and will continue to do so for another year and a half.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:05:16:09],00:05:47:04,"And that was this. This, if you know anything about the Alcatraz occupation, and I'll talk about it, greater detail shortly. It it was the catalyst for, a series of American Indian, movement renaissance in the 1970s. And it was on the world stage. It was followed by, very by the American media. And it was a nearly 20 month long occupation.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:05:47:06],00:06:30:10,"And, that became the model in some ways, for other indigenous groups to have similar both the expression of resistance and the means of resistance, to, to further, indigenous causes. So I want to start with her and this quote, which is a lengthy quote, I have to read it, in its entirety, but it's a quote by the Ka Lahui Hawaii, and which is, Hawaiian organization dedicated to Hawaiian sovereignty or Hawaiian independence and, of Native Hawaiians and, reclamation of the Hawaiian archipelago for Native Hawaiians.",indigenous;conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:06:30:12],00:07:02:07,"And, the title of this article was the ""Next Step toward Sovereignty Project Hawaiian Justice"". And what I thought was really interesting is it was a series of bullet points. And one of the bullet points, I think this was number three was working with, American Indians and finding this commonality of experience and commonality experience, in the face of Western settler colonial hegemony and racism and marginalization, and, a loss of culture, a loss of language and a realization that these goals can be met.",migration;history
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:07:04:00],00:07:31:17,"In an alliance or in solidarity with one another. And, it's an article, that clearly is tying Hawaiian, sovereignty interests directly back to American, Indian, similar struggles over sovereignty and land. So the way this will work, I have, brief, my wife helped me this down because she said it was way too long.",conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:07:31:17],00:07:56:11,"So I'll try to keep it brief. History of, native Hawaiians in the Hawaiian kingdom. Because I think it's really important. Just like I was talking about with understanding, say American Indian societies before Columbus or Hawaiian society before, Cook, it's important to have some context or background to to the struggle and that many people don't really know that much about the history of Hawai'i.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:07:57:02],00:08:21:19,"Prior to, prior to cook and, and so we'll we'll talk a bit about that, and then we'll talk about Hawaii in the 20th century. And then I have just five examples of indigenous agency, starting with the Alcatraz occupation in 1969, moving to the, the colony, occupation, which is an island in Hawaii. And there's a direct consequence of Alcatraz.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:08:21:21],00:08:56:03,"And then at the same time, the hokule'a, which is available on, double hold, traditional Hawaiian sailing vessel that sails thousands of miles to Tahiti using traditional techniques and navigation for the first time in 600 years. And then two further examples, more recently, the standing Rock, protests in North Dakota and, the Mauna Kea protest over the 30 Meter Telescope, in 2015 and as recently as 2019.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:08:56:05],00:09:19:03,"So that's my talk in a nutshell. Some terms, I'm going to use and, can reference back here. Is it important to use the Hawaiian term the kanaka maoli means the native Hawaiian people. 'Ohana is family. 'Aina is land. To malama 'aina means to care for the land. To aloha 'aina is to love the land.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:09:19:20],00:09:44:02,"It's necessary to be pono. That's to say, righteous or achieve some degree of reciprocity and to provide goodwill. Kuleana which is responsibility. And the Kia'i would be a guardian who was charged with the Kwinana the responsibility to do aloha, Aina and malama. I meant to care and love the land. And it's up to an ohana group to do that.",education
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:09:46:03],00:10:16:24,"A couple other term, an Ahupua'a is a traditional land district, which references. And you can still see them today. If you go to why say it? It designates where they are, and signs but they're shaped slices of traditional land, under the, under the traditional system before they overthrow well before the creation of ali'i and certainly before the overthrow of the, the maka'ainana people, but the common people, which is to be distinguished from the elite or the leaders.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:10:17:01],00:10:40:12,"And finally, much of what we understand, what I understand comes from .... And those are stories or histories, the Hawaiian people have preserved and many of those are preserved through something that people most commonly associate when they think of Hawaiian culture, which is hula. ..., chanting and they Ali'i or leaders and finally mana or power.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:10:41:10],00:11:11:22,"So, do this really quickly. So there we anthropologists, archeologists traced, through pottery, a group called the Lapita people, from, New Guinea to, to the Fiji, Tonga, Samoa region, where they arrived probably 3000 years ago, at least. Maybe, earlier. For about a thousand years, these people who wanted to live, Peter stayed in that, general area in the western Pacific before.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:11:11:22],00:11:38:21,"And they develop a distinctly Polynesian, culture, language and traditions. And this is a this is known as, or one of the, the, the homeland idea of this would be Hawaiki and Hawaiki would is the Polynesian Garden of Eden, this place, where Polynesian people came from and the term Hawaii, you have the glottal stop where you replace the k.",history
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:11:39:08],00:12:07:03,"When, when these Polynesians arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, they named that that from Hawaiki. This, this, this special place. And they did arrive, after about a thousand years in the Fiji, Tonga area. He's Polynesian people who are very smart, very good navigators. Very adept sailors, sailed thousands of miles across open ocean. And they encounter the Society Islands or the, the Haitian chain, the tumultuous, the marks and chain.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:12:07:03],00:12:36:23,"And eventually they move northward into, crossing the equator to the Hawaiian chain. They also find, Rapa Nui, aka Easter Island and Otero, also known as a New Zealand. And if you look at my little map here, you have this Polynesian triangle, locked in on the far East by Rapa Nui, to the north by, the Hawaiian Islands, and in this, southwest by, by Terra.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:12:37:00],00:13:00:17,"And you can see, the Samoa, Fiji, Tongan area here, which is the heart of the lipid of culture. In addition to reaching Rapa Nui, we know from a couple of reasons, a couple of ways that, these other Polynesian explorers also reached the coast of South America, you know, that because they brought back sweet potatoes.",history
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:13:01:08],00:13:22:05,"And these sweet potatoes were then farmed, throughout Polynesia, notably, all the way to New Zealand. But in Hawaii, certainly. And, most recently, they've done DNA testing of, of indigenous peoples and Rapanui and find similar DNA lines as people and ... area. So there was this connection, but there was no long term settlement.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:13:22:12],00:13:49:21,"The Polynesians remained and ocean and island, people. So Hawaii was colonized during this time between 500 and 1400 of the common era. When they colonized, they, divided the land up into these things called Ahu tours US, which was start at the top of the mountain and go down to the ocean. And each of these who put us would be turned over to, kinship groups of commoners known as the maka'ainana, to work at.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:13:49:23],00:14:14:07,"They have a different notion of land ownership. The land is useful for its productive value, not in terms of of its acreage, not in terms of its territory, but land is worked, and is used for both livestock and the Polynesian voyagers brought livestock with them, like pigs and chickens and dogs, but also the they also brought plants with them, like taro, sweet potatoes, breadfruit, bananas, coconuts and other.",agriculture
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:14:14:09],00:14:33:00,"And so, they would the, the and in addition, they created fishponds. And these fishponds were very sustainable. And and there's an elite class over these people known as the elite and a priest class. The kahuna is and both the elite and kahuna is basically able to live off of the productive excess of of the ahupua'a.",agriculture;religion
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:14:33:12],00:14:57:19,"To keep the hope was sustainable. They developed a couple laws which would say, don't overfishing, Erik, don't overhunting here. Don't, give the grounds a rest when it needs to be. And so you would put it off limits temporarily. Eventually. You see the development by the 1500s and 1600s of a high kingship. And these are known as ali'i nui, which would be a great king or an ali'i akua to be a god king.",agriculture
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:14:58:04],00:15:14:14,"And some of the command may of the first would certainly fit in that bill. It was forbidden by this point for the market and cannot even look at them, but their shadow fall on them. They were required to give them tribute. But this tribute was supposed to be held in Kono, meaning the elite had to be righteous.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:15:14:14],00:15:35:21,"They had a ... and allowed the ... to care for the land. So, this is the system that Hawaii worked in, and we're talking ruling from maybe 4 to 500 colonists to a population of at least half a million. And some, some have estimated upwards of 800,000 at the time of Captain Cook's arrival in 1778.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:15:36:03],00:16:01:19,"Finally, there's a Makahiki, which is a wintertime peak season when, when no war can happen. And where, the god Lono, is a, is the god of fertility and rain is, allowed to collect tribute for the, the early. This is when the amok an island I would give it what they had, in tribute to, you know, to the early.",conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:16:01:21],00:16:29:04,"Since the Hawaiian Islands. And this is in 1778, cook arrives and dies. We'll just move on from that. We don't have time, but cook gets killed in an altercation on the Big Island. Okay? Okay, cool. Okay. And, when the expedition returns back to London, unlike previous Pacific expeditions, like the Spanish, who not really had not stumbled onto Hawaii, London.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:16:31:11],00:16:49:18,"Royal Society made sure to publish these things. So all of a sudden Hawaii was on the map. And then it was like the fur trade, and whaling it became. And missionaries became a very popular place. Subsequently, notably, if you're in Idaho, you know, the Hawaii, River and the Hawaii mountain range not too far from Boise.",boise
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:16:49:18],00:17:19:04,"This is why he means Hawaii. And these are, Hawaiians who are brought in by fur traders to work the inner, rivers. And, three Hawaiians were lost, in the early 19th century in this, Hawaii. So Idaho has that connection. So to understand why Hawaiians, or how the language and culture and traditions the Twin Cities use and resistance, takes a little bit of background here.",environment;history;conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:17:19:15],00:17:40:12,"Kamehameha. The first is I can't go I don't have time to go through all of the the rulers of Hawaii. But Kamehameha is certainly, worth noting in part because he using Western ships and weapons and, even artillery muskets is able to not. He's the king of the Big Island of Hawaii, but he eventually conquers the rest of the archipelago.",conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:17:40:14],00:18:16:14,"And he does this by around 1800. Within, ten, 12 years. Cook. And this is important it's important for the purposes of this talk, which is he unifies Hawaii under a single kingship, and that means that the Western people would have to deal with him, and they couldn't try to play, one chieftain off against the other, which they had done very successfully, in the Americas, with, with massive Americans and Native Americans, trying to, divide and conquer and, and pull one tribe off to another tribe and get them to agree to the terms of the treaty, which over people they didn't have power over, or to use those people",indigenous;conflict

There's no crack there for Westerners to exploit this. Kamehameha. This is where he died in 1819 on the Big Island. After his death, you see an end. This is the beginning of change in Hawaii. And that's the end to traditional religious practices.",conflict;religion

And they bring Christianity to the island.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:19:10:13],00:19:42:00,"And Bingham is notably one of these. And with the conversion of capital careful, Monahan convinces her stepson and ruler, the whole to end and the old ways and the worship of the of the Hawaiian gods, including Pele and, Killua.

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:19:42:02],00:20:15:18,"And they do a certain, I know, a ritual, which is to say that men and women eat publicly together, and that's forbidden under Hawaiian law. And by doing that, it ends, and ends the at forcible conversion, starting at the highest level of Hawaiian society of people into Christianity.

And that is the great my healing and the adoption of of a Parliament. He's convinced by these missionaries that if he wants to, be, recognized kingdom on a global scale by Europeans, they have to do a they have to do a British style parliament with a constitution or a monarchy, which he agrees to.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:20:41:13],00:21:06:03,"And then later they, they, also push him to go to a simple style land ownership, which means no longer awkward for us. It means we're going to take all the land and everybody gets title to it. Now you see the same struggle going on in Native American reservations with the notion of land being held by the tribe, as a whole, versus land being held individually, breaking up with the reservation and giving it to individuals.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:21:06:12],00:21:28:05,"It's even worse in Hawaii. In the Great Mahal, there's about 4 million acres of land in Hawaii. And they decide they'll divide it up in three, one third to the king, one third to the nobles, the elite, and some of these highly or white advisors, and one third to the marking on on the commoners.

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:21:53:17],00:22:15:08,"So this land. The point of this is this. When you go to Hawaii today, the, the state land and the federal land, that 1.8 million acres is the Crown lands of the king. That was the end of the monarchy. But it goes back to this great. Mahalo.

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:23:06:13],00:23:30:13,"He gets bored of genealogies together, so that he can record the genealogies of the elite Inui. And what you see here is he's negotiating between Western imperialism and the needs of Western imperialism that is being forced upon the islands, as well as a Native Hawaiian resurgence and cultural values. So calcul he tries to he tries to do it both ways.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:23:30:23],00:24:03:14,"But his work on Native Hawaiian Agency, backfires with with the how these who force, bayonet the so-called bayonet constitution on Hawaii in 1887. By this point, the missionaries of their second or third generation, they're very wealthy. They've taken over much of the land. They are royal advisors and, they basically force this constitution on the monarchy, which reduces the monarchy to a figurehead and disenfranchizes Native Hawaiians and other Asian migrants.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:24:03:21],00:24:31:10,"All power now goes to how those who constitute less than 5% of the population. He dies and his sister colony takes power. This is the Honolulu, the rifles, the how they militia enforcing the ban Constitution. And lineal colonies. She refuses to be in a constitution.

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:24:31:12],00:25:01:04,"And what are the missionaries do? They convince John Stevens, who's the US minister to the Hawaiian Kingdom, to use American Marines and the USS Boston in, Honolulu Harbor to, occupy Iolani Palace and overthrow the Queen.

And now Hawaii suddenly has a strategic resupply point. And it should be.",conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:26:14:22],00:26:43:21,"No, coincidence, then, that the US government, in a simple majority vote, Congress just, annexed Hawaii, over the wishes of the Hawaiian people or the wishes of the previous president. And really, a colonial day in 1917 with her day, 1000 more or more years of Hawaiian independence. So compare that brief history. It was probably too long, and I'm sorry, but then I tried to cover the main points.",history
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:26:43:23],00:27:02:17,"You can look at that. And I've kind of put this to here from between 1820 and 1898. And you can see how this works. The end of traditional religion, the banning of hula, the beginning of constitutionalism, the great Malay, the changing constitutions, the Bayonet Constitution, the overthrow of the monarchy, the banning of the Hawaiian language and then annexation.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:27:02:19],00:27:32:13,"And then you can also compare that to what has happening in the American West. In Idaho, Fort Hall and for Boise are established pretty early. The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, which includes standing Rock land is enacted and guarantees not just standing Rock, but the land where the current Dapl pipeline is, to the standing Rock Sioux, in Colorado, the Sand Creek massacre, Red Cloud's War, a second treaty, the Great Sioux Law, Custer's Last Stand, the Nez Perce War, Geronimo.",boise;conflict

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:27:45:15],00:28:21:07,"All right. Keep going. Here's. So, White marginalization under Hollis. Three things happened. Hawaiians are basically kicked off their own land, which is now dominated by a planter elite. They are, removed from their own culture. But, linguistically, traditionally, in terms of hula and other aspects to how they now dominate and as a population, they're a minority in their own country, maybe 25%, 40,000 people in 1900 of roughly 160,000 people on the island.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:28:21:07],00:28:32:22,"Actually, the largest group would be the Japanese at about 40%. And whites or holidays make up only 5%.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:28:32:24],00:29:02:18,"So looking at Native American versus Hawaiian experiences, and only with an hour, I can't get into all the details on this I'd like to talk about. But we do see one advantage that the Hawaiians have and that a centralized authority to how they cannot pit these chiefs against one another. But you also see this wider Hawaiian identification of other Pacific peoples, particularly Polynesian peoples, Tongans, Samoan stations, Maori and others, rather than continental American indigenous peoples like American Indians and Hawaiian people are not recognized as a tribe or nation.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:29:02:18],00:29:44:18,"There are 573 recognized tribes, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Hawaii. People are not one of them. And that's a sticking point. Even today, there's been no agreement by the federal government to recognize Hawaiian people, as an indigenous self, governance entity. But despite that, we see some similarities here the loss of sovereignty, the broken treaties, the dispossession of land and the loss of culture for schooling, basti population and marginalization, outcome and removal from political and economic power loss, at statehood in 1959 gives you an idea of the Hawaiians, which is the lavender versus the other ethnic groups in Hawaii.",indigenous

Here's 100 prayers, a Native Hawaiian at Standing Rock. And I guess my last point, because I've got to wrap this up, is, why oppose astronomy? This is how it's posed. I mean, this notion that it's a benign science, it's passive, it grants knowledge to people, or we can recast it as why are Native Hawaiians standing in the way of discovery?",

Some critics even cast Native Hawaiian resistance as anti-science, comparing them to basically the Catholic Church and the Inquisition, attacking Galileo.

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:50:49:14],00:51:13:14,"And they can determine the nature of that entity, but it doesn't grant independence. And so, it's it's in limbo because many of the same people who are opposing the TMT, who are standing at standing Rock are also saying, why should we take a bad deal? If we take a bad deal, we'll never get a good deal.

We are not going to compromise. And it we've got a long game here and we're winning this game. So you can say the starting point of this is to say that if you want the TMT, then you have to negotiate with Native Hawaiians on as equals and say, we understand that the basis of this negotiation, you may say no and never say yes.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:51:55:00],00:52:15:08,"And none of those negotiations have ever gone that direction. They've never started with the notion of it's not, no, it's not an option.

So, the conclusion of this is really intersectionality. And the intersectionality is looking at solidarities with, American Indian movements on all of these examples with between mainland indigenous peoples, including native Hawaiians in the diaspora, those 40% of native Hawaiians don't live in Hawai'i to live in most in the mainland United States, including in places like, Salt Lake and in Boise and, places like your Cepa, which is a, old, Hawaiian community, in west of",indigenous;migration;boise

At the time that had happened, there was actually, a rebellion of of priests in, on the Big Island against the imposition of Christianity. But they were ultimately, ultimately they were pushed down.

And they, initially stay very closely to themselves, meaning that they, they, they marry other Japanese and stay within a Japanese community. There are moments of, of overlap and crossover. For instance, at the time of the of the 1864 Constitution leading to the Bayonet Constitution, there is increasing voting solidarity amongst Asian migrants and the Hawaiian community against a highly minority in France.",

Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:58:24:24],00:58:46:22,"There is a split. There are, there are, it's a group. I mean, Senator Akaka, who is of Hawaiian descent himself, is the one who introduced this this, federal recognition bill, which is a compromise bill. It basically puts, Native Hawaiians on par with Native Americans in terms of the BIA. And that's a so there's a split between those who would support this kind of centrist approach of we need to get something.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:58:46:22],00:59:07:23,"We need to have some sort of settlement, we need federal recognition, and we need to to accept that. Or maybe we're never going to get the 1.8 million acres back. And then there are others, the group that we've seen, like with the TMT, on those supporting standing Rock and others who say no, why why would we, if if the coup of 1893 is illegal and then everything that follows from it is illegal?",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:59:08:00],00:59:33:06,"Nothing. You can't sell me stolen land. You can't offer me 10% of land when I. When you stolen 100% of it. And and so I would in my, observation of the of how the community has been debating. There is no clear direction forward right now because, the sovereignty movement, is demanding something that the federal government isn't, allowing.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:59:33:08],00:59:52:18,"And, then you also have to fundamentally, at some point, I would argue you probably would have to deal with the fact that there are obviously, large groups, 80% of the population of Hawaii today is non Hawaiian. That doesn't mean that they don't sympathize with or identify with with, the goals of the, native movement.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[00:59:53:07],00:59:59:20,"But it's a, a really complicated issue. And as no clear solution.",
Doug Exton,[00:59:59:22],01:00:45:21,"Yeah. And as you touched on earlier, the with, you know, the sovereignty movement and other indigenous movements, Hawaiians kind of tend to have more of a, I can't think of the right word, but they kind of identify more with like Polynesian culture as a whole rather than other indigenous tribes. The continental US. So do you think that kind of I don't want to call it a rift, because as you've shown, it's definitely not, you know, rift in a negative way, but that cultural difference has that impacted, you know, either moves or saw for sovereignty on Hawaii's part or, you know, just kind of Hawaiian perception, you know, in these roles.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:00:45:23],01:01:10:10,"And, yeah, I mean, so traditionally, and we could see this going back to David, King David, Calcutta and others that, that Hawaiians were seeking, both as an independent kingdom and then post overthrow to create these wider connections with other Polynesians. And you could see that with, my, my experience with the Polynesian community here in Boise or in the Salt Lake community.",boise
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:01:10:12],01:01:31:17,"And you see that with the question about the flags, if you go to yourself, a migrant migration, I, Jack Johnson, things seem to really, really work there. And, you see pictures of, the, behind the graves of the ancestors. And these components are the flags of Samoa and the flags of, Tahiti and of, of New Zealand.",migration;history
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:01:31:17],01:01:59:17,"And, all of these different Polynesian communities are represented. And so what the reason I gave this talk, was because I was moving past the notion that it was a pan Polynesian identity, which is important. And that's what the hokule'a really connected back to. Is this this pan Polynesian identity and the shared experience in, of island people in the Pacific with imperialism, the settler colonialism, but also this increasing connection to mainland, to the mainland.",migration
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:01:59:17],01:02:28:05,"And it comes in two directions. It comes with the diaspora of, native Hawaiians living in the American West and places like Boise or California. In Nevada, there's a very large Hawaiian community in Salt Lake. There's an enormous Polynesian community. And but also to Native Americans, to the American Indian. And you see that and you can see it at these key points, like it's standing Rock, that it's not just a it's not just about Polynesians standing as Polynesians, it's about indigenous peoples standing with other indigenous peoples and playing off of one another's movements.",migration;boise;indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:02:28:14],01:02:50:15,"In fact, come up to a case, so, another, former student at Boise State, got in touch with me, last week, and was talking about Pacific World class, and, he, when his name Nick, blue. So. And he's doing PhD, in college, William and Mary.",education;boise
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:02:50:19],01:03:12:16,"And he did a really nice, job of translating, Amelia for me from, come up with a case, and it's mainly that she had written for Monica, but then rewrote it for, for standing Rock and to bring standing Rock into it. And water protectors, which are similar the, the Chi, the Guardian protectors. Monica.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:03:12:21],01:03:32:22,"So you she and then she goes, she rewrites this, this is her, her Emily. And then she goes and sings it, at standing Rock. And so it complicates this notion of, of endogeneity and, and solidarity that it's that we can move beyond the Polynesian connection to this American connection.",
Doug Exton,[01:03:32:24],01:03:57:00,"Know, and I think, you know, tying into that, it's also kind of, perspective of we are in like we are, you know, a state in the United States, it makes sense for us to be involved in these other native movements since we have a similar perspective, you know, of colonialism and stuff like that, with the fact that, you know, they were annexed essentially into the US.",
Doug Exton,[01:03:57:02],01:03:57:11,But yeah.,
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:03:57:15],01:04:19:14,"If you go back to that first quote on that presentation and I can make a, I can give you the presentation, people want to look at it. But, that quote really says, you know, Native American tribes are or fully aware of the incompetency and corruptions that have occurred in tribal government level and at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and use it using that knowledge, using that experience.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:04:19:24],01:04:42:14,"They can see for the shoulder with the native Hawaiian organizations and say, you know, you can ask for a better deal than the one that's being offered. And, you know, if you wear underwear, with what seems to be probably is. And so there, there is this, this, this, that, that one thing that, that Samoans, Tongans, to Haitians and other Polish communities are not necessarily.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:04:42:14],01:04:54:20,"Well, the civilians are, the American civilians are. But outside of the American Samoans, none of these other politics are not directly dealing with the United States government. The federal government and American Indians have been and continue to do so.",
Doug Exton,[01:04:54:22],01:05:19:23,"And and your will mentioned earlier with, all native Hawaiians are, you know, essentially wards of the state of Hawaii. And because of that, they can't sue not only the state government, they also can't sue the federal government. Is that something that was like unique to the Native Hawaiian experience, or is that also part of like the Native American tribes in the continental US?",
Doug Exton,[01:05:19:24],01:05:23:02,Because that was just something that struck me. It's really interesting.,
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:05:23:04],01:05:44:01,"I believe. And then you went on the call can, correct me if I'm wrong? I believe it is unique. So when I mean Sue, I don't mean like you can't sue in any court that you don't, but it means that in terms of, say, speaking on behalf of Native Hawaiians or speaking on behalf of Hawaiian lands, you can't sue for that.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:05:44:14],01:06:05:06,"Now, we have seen different groups in federal court actually do with suits have been brought up about TMT. There are suits have been brought up about the colony. So it's not a suggested that it means that you are considered a permanent ward of the state, but the Hawaiian, Native Hawaiian people as a community have no legal standing.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:06:06:00],01:06:27:21,"But, to speak as a, as a, as a group before, state or federal government because there's no recognition of them, as, as a legal, organization akin to a tribe that we're trying to, you know, just romantic tribe. And this person can, can, can sue in federal court as a tribe. Can the Queen still have that?",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:06:27:21],01:06:41:14,"Right? I think that's relatively I mean, there may be other groups. If you went to Puerto Rico or Guam or something, you might see similar things. But, as a, as a, as a native or indigenous group, it's relatively rare.",indigenous
Doug Exton,[01:06:41:16],01:07:04:22,"And do you think that is partially, due to the fact that, Cleveland, you know, found the annexation process of Hawaii kind of illegal? Do you think that was like a way for the federal government to maybe protect themselves and a little bit, since they didn't offer Hawaii the same status as indigenous tribes in America?",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:07:04:24],01:07:30:04,"Yeah. I mean, that's why I spent a little more time in more time than I should have on the history. Part of things is to point out in some ways, why it is so exceptional that we can see these connections today, because the history in some ways was very different, that you have a single, you have a single, monarchy, which is internationally recognized by the British, by the French, by the Japanese, by all these other countries as an actual country.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:07:30:04],01:07:55:21,"And that's not to say that Native Americans didn't occasionally achieve that as well. But in general, you can look at most of the America, the American West, in which, from the time of the Louisiana Purchase, they are viewing Native Americans as basically occupiers of land that is under the jurisdiction of the American government, and thus they can't ever and still today, tribal government can't ask for for sovereignty.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:07:55:21],01:08:10:04,"It can't be identified. It it can, you know, you can make them tax free or you can build a casino, you can have tribal police, you can do all these things, but you don't get to say, and now we're going to open an embassy and invite the British in. We're going to join the United Nations over a new country.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:08:11:02],01:08:29:10,"So that's something that's different, though. The Hawaiians had that. And so when they come in, when they're forcibly annexed in the troubles with the whole annexation treaty and how it feels and how, one American president calls it illegal, how the initial annexation falls apart. And it's only after the Spanish-American War and a change in administration. So you see that happen, just like you see it happening.",conflict
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:08:29:10],01:08:56:21,"A standing rock, change in administration is what fundamentally leads to this. The, the the collapse of the of a native claim here. And, in doing so, yes. They annex the Hawaiian Islands but never address the Hawaiians, the native Hawaiians, as, as a group. And, in part because the houses, the white people had taken over, they taken over the government.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:08:56:21],01:09:16:18,"So if you were to say, well, with a tribe or we have, native tribe, elders, men and women speaking on behalf of this tribe, it's not a bunch of of third generation white guys doing it. And that's what happens in Hawaii is they they overthrow the government and then claim it. And they claim to they they take the lands.",indigenous
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:09:16:20],01:09:42:18,"Now they try to wash their hands of it. And when annexation occurs, they turn all the crown lands over to the to the fans and to the state, and so it looks like they're not actually benefiting from it, but they are because they lease it. And and, and so, it's a peculiar aspect of history that the native Hawaiians, unlike other groups, never are never given formal recognition.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:09:43:05],01:09:46:24,"As a, as an indigenous people, the way others are.",indigenous
Doug Exton,[01:09:47:01],01:10:07:15,"Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for tonight. So I did want to say thank you again, Doctor Hadley, for being with me tonight and giving us that wonderful brief overview of Hawaiian history and all the different movements. I think you did a really good job showing those connections. You know, outside of the Polynesian world, because I did take your Pacific world class.",
Doug Exton,[01:10:08:14],01:10:16:21,"So in that class, we definitely talked a lot about those connections. So I think he really showed the other side of that coin with the connections to the indigenous tribes in the U.S.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:10:16:23],01:10:31:01,"Well, Doug, it was a pleasure, and thank you very much for inviting me. And to everyone on this call, I, feel free to email me. With any questions. It's very simple. Erik Hadley at Boise state dot edu, and thank you for your time tonight.",boise
Doug Exton,[01:10:31:03],01:10:32:19,"Yeah, have a good night, everyone.",
Dr. Erik Hadley,[01:10:32:21],01:10:37:12,Thank you.,
