    "description": "This special episode of Context is dedicated to families impacted by organ donation. Johanna is joined by Heather Platts and Bruce Michael Miller, the musical duo Crazy Love. Heather donated a kidney to Bruce, and together they created an album to share their story and inspire others facing the organ donation process. Heather Platts is a passionate performer whose style is reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt and Grace Potter. She earned a BA in Music Composition from the University of Idaho in 1996 and has released two albums recorded in Nashville. She has performed at the Boise Music Festival, Thousand Springs Festival of Art, Sisters in Songwriting Concert Series, and the inaugural Chick Singer Night in Boise. Heather teaches voice, piano, and songwriting in Twin Falls. Bruce Michael Miller is an award-winning songwriter, producer, and guitarist who has toured with Paul McCartney, Kenny Loggins, and Laura Branigan. A professional songwriter for 25 years in Nashville, he has had over 40 songs recorded, including a No. 1 international hit with country artist Ashley Puckett. As a songwriting consultant and educator, he has mentored writers on over 14,000 songs and was a professor at Nashville State College. Since relocating to Idaho in 2017, Bruce has embraced the region’s landscapes and community. As president of the Idaho Songwriters Association, he teaches songwriting workshops and works with private clients. Heather and Bruce perform throughout the West as Crazy Love and are part of the Inquiring Idaho program.",
