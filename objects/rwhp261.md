00;21;24;03 - Unknown Interviewer: I have a really? Even though you already have the name. I don't know why you think I can wait until I had the baby.

You might have changed your mind because of the baby or because your emotions are different or something better.

00;21;46;24 - Bonnie Nellsch: Do you have any kids? Oh, how do.

00;21;49;07 - Unknown Interviewer: You feel about that? Yeah, when I was married, one of them, and I am now because I knew what I wanted.

00;22;19;27 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh. You're in. Wait. We're talking. We're not talking.

00;22;47;29 - Bonnie Nellsch: That's the thing. Nobody knows about it. I know I've seen it on TV, but just recently. And I wasn't aware of the fact that you could write up your own divorce.

00;22;55;26 - Unknown Interviewer: No, I was not.

00;22;57;05 - Bonnie Nellsch: The lawyers up here aren't going to tell you that you can write up your own little divorce for about $75, isn't it? in California? Is it less than that? Well.

00;23;06;23 - Unknown Interviewer: It used to be 47 or something like that. Not very long for me. Have you all.

00;23;13;00 - Bonnie Nellsch: Convinced that the only way you can do it is if you go through them?

00;23;16;16 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. I wanted to write you for a divorce, and I paid for myself because I definitely want,

00;23;23;18 - Bonnie Nellsch: Some woman in California is really pushing it, and she's off for the the women of a day know I. I've never heard of it. I just saw it on TV the other day. I thought it was great. You know, the people on your door.

00;23;36;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. You're not ready.

00;23;37;19 - Vicki Mitchell: For the hot weather, man. How long you live here? I am. Well, why do you think you.

00;23;51;05 - Unknown Interviewer: For instance. Oh, I hate to bring this up into the conversation. Okay. You, for instance, I know of a person that she didn't know what you are, and she didn't know what she looked like. Married to the air. She wanted you here to get out. Really? What she wanted for. She decided she wanted a divorce, but she wasn't for sure.

00;24;15;15 - Unknown Interviewer: Right. You know, well, in a case like this. Because I don't know anything about right now. You know what? I don't understand what you're really talking about. But in a case like this, if she went ahead and wrote up Brown divorce, well, then they would. This couple with the divorce not long after work, two months to two months, she ran around without her kids move out of their home.

00;24;37;09 - Unknown Interviewer: I want to decide who I am now or who how they were still married. The husband told them that you know, or took her back. I should say. Well, but I mean, you know, I just want to make a quick decision right into it. Yeah, yeah, well, you can get everything right and then get married, right? But, I think what you do is you just write up all the legal things.

00;25;04;22 - Bonnie Nellsch: All right? It's difficult that you put up between a circuit, before circuit judge or something.

00;25;10;15 - Unknown Interviewer: And then you have to wait for the 22 days or whatever. Right. It's all right. I just I just feel like, if you really want a divorce, right? I definitely wanted a divorce. It would have been great. But for somebody that that is. Well, I think I do. I think I want to work around. No, I don't want to.

00;25;34;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Or this particular lawyer.

00;25;35;25 - Bonnie Nellsch: I'm talking about. Or she says she talks with the people first and she just they don't rest right in anything. I think they in fact, a lot of times, she said, they'll suggest the marriage counselor, everything else before that, even right up there on the board. The only thing that she said that she's trying to accomplish is to get the people.

00;25;54;23 - Unknown Interviewer: From.

00;25;55;29 - Bonnie Nellsch: Supporting these high class lawyers that are really putting the money in their pocket. Yeah, you know, 600, anywhere from 600 to several thousand dollars for a divorce, which they could right now, their their.

00;26;11;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Okay. How did you meet your, Husband who was stationed in Okinawa. And my started writing to him.

Then I got married and he's going government back to Vietnam. Then right away, I knew my marriage wasn't going to work for the divorce. And so I started writing her to the same girlfriend he wrote. I told him that I was getting a divorce, and he said, that you'd like to start writing to me again, but he'd never write for Slam.

She was interested in this guy that I do now. And, I just got out of the Navy, and, I didn't have anything much to do, and so I found a job, and so I, she suggested that I start writing to him because she wasn't going to write to him anymore.

00;30;06;01 - Bonnie Nellsch: So I started writing to him. And he was in Vietnam at the time.

That that area is getting real rough anymore, and I wouldn't walk through there. There's a lot of hippies in, and, Well, I don't know, we call them hippies, but they're long hair and dopers and, I think bad area to walk around.

00;31;00;26 - Bonnie Nellsch: I wouldn't walk through there at night by myself.

00;31;03;18 - Unknown Interviewer: Why did you have a beer? You could walk around for? Well, for instance, my mother and I would come home one the. And, there was a group of boys or girls from eight into that 25 years old stripper in a car, and she didn't dare stop and say anything because she's glad to have had her car stripped right down to.

00;31;30;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Is that graffiti that there was, you know, going around stripping cars that they could get off what they could used. And, The people are so different. They're just people are a small town, are a lot friendlier. You're neighbors in a big town. You're right. Your next door neighbor, you don't speak to your. You speak directly to your or ignore you or.

00;31;55;22 - Bonnie Nellsch: Oh, I think they go in that car and so on. Somebody was on the phone and call because would have been right there, you know. Oh yeah.

00;32;02;15 - Unknown Interviewer: Where I so it sounds like nobody wanted to interfere. We want to get involved. Nobody wanted to get involved. You just don't. Do you have the police around here? I think so, I think sometimes we do. I think sometimes we don't. I had a prowler up one day. One night, scared there. And I heard something outside. It was him, and late at night.

00;32;28;18 - Unknown Interviewer: And I opened up my curtains and he was scaring them. And I was just him. And it scared me to death. I would think that something was out there. And my husband says, oh, you're always hearing stuff. And I said, oh, no. And I described what the guy was like. And so he put on his clothes and ran outside, and it had been raining where you see where the guy had been.

00;32;49;29 - Unknown Interviewer: He kept working with them. When it's cold. And I called the police and they were right down here, right down here. But then, something else happened and they never showed up at all. And so I oftentimes I spoke right around the house or something. I don't know, sometimes they're right there in front of them. I don't know.

00;33;13;27 - Unknown Interviewer: I think I got them because they're in somebody's.

00;33;22;28 - Unknown Interviewer: Home. I'm not sure that would be perfect for I don't care. So, yeah, I had.

00;33;29;18 - Bonnie Nellsch: A problem, too. It wasn't. It wasn't right at my house. I happened to be putting my kids to bed, and I was upstairs, and I had to look out, and this guy walked in front of the house, and then he walked into the back of the house. The only thing in the back of my house is the neighbors little house.

00;33;44;03 - Bonnie Nellsch: They went out only wasn't being rented out at the time. So I watched this character and I went to the other side of the house and looked out my bedroom window, and he was. He, let himself walk into the back of the house back there. And so I went ahead and call the police, but they were right out there, and they got him, cornered him underneath the bed in that house.

00;34;03;12 - Bonnie Nellsch: Your car.

00;51;50;28 - Bonnie Nellsch: So, you know, probably because we see our mother, you. And when we were young. When she was young. And so therefore, when we.

00;51;59;18 - Unknown Interviewer: All.

00;52;00;21 - Bonnie Nellsch: Grew up and got married, she was still young enough to get out and do what they want to do. And I'm the old and.

00;52;58;13 - Vicki Mitchell: I don't want.

00;53;03;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Them or any normal group or. I'm not. I don't think I can handle through, if I could, if I had to.

01;06;16;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Feel I don't I don't know if it's your hamburger. I don't think it crosses the line. We went down. I have this bigger picture that we had after spending the money for the peaches on the right, evaluating my car. I've been doing some work on the gray.

01;06;34;03 - Bonnie Nellsch: Yeah,

01;06;36;08 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, just the money was. It wasn't worth it. I figured can was check out my garage, cuz otherwise.

01;06;42;25 - Bonnie Nellsch: Well, as far as peaches go, my mom, she's can peaches too. She said you definitely don't come out money wise at all here. The only difference is it's so much better quality and the it tastes so much better. Other than that, you're not going on peaches, but on other things you might well, on my farm I know right to your.

01;07;02;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Farm out of the peaches I bought with me. And like on Clarkston it was in Moscow, so I don't know when they were picking. I know the plant was having picked recently, you know. Right, right. The prices were supposed to.

01;07;24;25 - Bonnie Nellsch: For all the house we had to go through. It was was awesome.

01;07;29;00 - Unknown Interviewer: For that, for our my garden. Oh, can you do things you can't fulfill for your reason? Why do you say why or why you don't have any wheat bread? Yeah. It was it turned out really good. I enjoyed baking, but I do enjoy doing that. It's important to do it. Yeah, I remember mom was great. Grandma work a chore.

01;08;15;13 - Bonnie Nellsch: Quit because, like I said, you get that fresh bread and I can eat a whole loaf myself practically after comes out of the oven with butter, you know.

01;08;23;16 - Unknown Interviewer: That's right. But I, I can I wouldn't stop myself to do that. But I got where I was baking every time I baked bread. I had to give a lot. so. And so I had to figure out that this one. So it really girl. But it's like you're done not having that for your family. Once you give them their one compliment or, you know, where are you like to try different recipes.

01;08;46;22 - Bonnie Nellsch: Definitely.

01;08;48;12 - Unknown Interviewer: yeah, I do. My husband is taking care of me and so he doesn't really enjoy it as much, right? Yeah, I do, you try different recipes for your bread. I see, I, I've tried and like I said, I make the wheat bread from Brown County. I make some bread. I like bread.

01;09;36;09 - Bonnie Nellsch: It's kind of a hassle sometimes. Well, not so much now, but when the kids were younger, it was a hassle because you all like running out from. But now they pretty much, entertain themselves. So you can do it better too.

01;09;47;17 - Unknown Interviewer: But now we can make breakfast with pies, and you don't go after you get the ball. You can play with that. Go back to the pie for hours and kind of pick up on that. It really keeps losing weight. Consider that. Don't keep people more disease and then some expensive course you've got.

01;10;10;03 - Unknown Interviewer: Them for ones who are not very often you don't have the patience to let them do it for everyone. Far. help help make cookies soft is more supervised. You may love the fact that you get to offer some there. I think you might do that. You should do most of your cooking. Good. Scratch.

01;10;43;27 - Bonnie Nellsch: I don't, I don't believe in like wine cans to and all that garbage, you.

01;10;47;25 - Unknown Interviewer: Know, I know garbage. That's refreshing. Okay. Right. And and from there in there. Right. You know, from over there, I have to be about everything.

01;10;57;14 - Bonnie Nellsch: Well, I have plant and canned vegetables. Okay. Oh, I like frozen vegetables better, but. And, canned soups. But that's about as far as the can stuff goes, you know? But I use soup and cooking too, though. Okay. I don't like, but. Right. I want.

01;11;15;09 - Unknown Interviewer: To camp on a.

01;11;16;04 - Bonnie Nellsch: Hand vegetable for months.

01;11;18;15 - Unknown Interviewer: I want to tell you that things are the dinners that are, you know, I or I.

01;11;24;10 - Bonnie Nellsch: Oh, frozen dinners and Hamburger Helper. now, I don't use that.

01;11;28;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. I guess this is a kind of a bad question. That's informative. Have you ever thought about what you would do if something were to happen to your husband?

01;11;41;19 - Bonnie Nellsch: Oh, yeah. Sure. Only for I work from a financial standpoint, what I would do to carry on afterwards. But other than that, I mean, we just sat down and discussed what we would do and what my. Oh yeah, and what he would want me to do and what I would want.

01;11;59;00 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you mind going into that?

01;12;02;16 - Bonnie Nellsch: Oh, I don't mind. now with, for instance, if he were to die, we would, we would discuss how much the insurance would cover on, any bills that we might have and how much the insurance. I would get money. And, I would, pay the house up a couple years in. Most things we have have an insurance on that would pay him off if I had any debts at the time, and then I would go ahead and wait till the girls were both in school.

01;12;32;14 - Bonnie Nellsch: And then I would go to a nursing school and, get married. And that's what I would do now if I were to die. I told him you would. Naturally, you would have that big of a problem as much as a wife would, I don't think, because he would still have his job and he would just carry on.

01;12;49;20 - Unknown Interviewer: And probably to find he would be careful.

01;12;52;04 - Bonnie Nellsch: Right. That would be his main problem. Whereas me, I'd be a little harder.

01;12;55;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. I guess your problem would be, if I was to die. There won't be during that here. Yeah. So there's never a way out. So we have kind of a situation where the worst happens. You guys, I just, I roll over my grave very regret. The girl, the car would really be bad if they were separated, so I don't know how things would turn out.

01;13;27;26 - Bonnie Nellsch: Their their wives legally could get.

01;13;30;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, you could legally have her. Although you never had a great year. Oh, no. well, I don't know how many you ever had or something like that, but that would be your own problem with trying to carry.

01;13;43;16 - Bonnie Nellsch: So what? What do I have to.

01;13;45;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Do if I'm happy to be out?

01;13;50;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Man. And I, I'm not a person to live by myself. I like the people I married.

01;14;00;25 - Unknown Interviewer: Well, I need you to support you. I like to have a man there to lean on. If something comes up, I. Well, I.

01;14;08;11 - Bonnie Nellsch: Have to, but my first thought wouldn't be the man. My first thought would be to handle my own life. I would have to grab whoever came.

01;14;16;19 - Unknown Interviewer: I would grab just over the came along. I would have to be, first man. That would be right for the kids and for you and for me. But I would never. What would I want you to do if that were correct? For 2 or 3 years? Oh, I mean time. What would I do? I really have no, I have no idea what for sure I would do.

01;14;40;05 - Unknown Interviewer: I retired from some, after the kids are in school over with my school. I tried to find something for this.

01;14;48;24 - Bonnie Nellsch: Well, you could live on Social Security and.

01;14;51;19 - Unknown Interviewer: I don't know, like it or not, you know, if you have kids, social security for tracing for myself. But I really could carry it.

01;14;58;24 - Bonnie Nellsch: You just have to trust me.

01;15;01;19 - Unknown Interviewer: This friend of the situation right here, this area is not at all interesting. It's really sad because I work for him. If you have one from senior, but he was not very nice. last time he was here was in January and he was in there volunteers to do two characters in Iraq he was more worried about,

01;15;32;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Bringing her arm in her back, which I was really, hurt over that because you would have thought, you know, he definitely ran worth more than he did. That means he was actually really impressed with your senior. But, I guess he was more interested in your father, who? So I'm hoping eventually that you will find out your doctor visits and central figure.

01;16;01;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. And every month, I think he was wearing the service. So we're going out about five months. He's been out. I haven't come out for five months. Going forward. You just automatically took it out. Check. Checking out my wife sometimes is concerned that, like.

01;16;23;04 - Unknown Interviewer: the directions the the child support I kind of ways that that kind of these. Yeah. Yeah that to you I, I think if I remember right there was it has to be over a certain amount and you doesn't pay over this amount to be able to have the right to clean up at that. He was trying to tell me he's happy, right?

01;16;47;22 - Unknown Interviewer: I don't want to do it. He wouldn't want who I knew. So I'm not going to say could claim ma'am, I refuse to. And have to back. Up.

01;17;06;20 - Unknown Interviewer: He was so very seldom. I'm not very there now.

01;17;14;12 - Bonnie Nellsch: I don't watch it at all. Hardly. During the day I have. I do have one so far that I watched that this.

01;20;42;25 - Unknown Interviewer: Wish your father involved in crime more. Yeah, I think so. It. World War two.

01;20;57;05 - Bonnie Nellsch: he was in the Navy.

01;20;59;13 - Unknown Interviewer: So I don't remember time. He was in World War two. I know that.

01;21;03;16 - Bonnie Nellsch: Because he was on, on a,

01;21;06;17 - Unknown Interviewer: Aircraft aircraft carrier. And in World War II, I don't remember that. I said, of course you don't remember that.

01;21;14;09 - Bonnie Nellsch: Oh, my. No, we don't remember it. I just know it because he told us and he showed me pictures.

01;21;19;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, I see that. But I don't know, I.

01;21;23;11 - Bonnie Nellsch: I, you know, but in that was one of the reasons I want to go in the Navy.

01;21;28;09 - Unknown Interviewer: But my dad,

01;21;31;02 - Vicki Mitchell: What happens when you think about Vietnam for.

01;21;36;08 - Unknown Interviewer: Rich man's war. Oh. How are your in spirit, rich man's war? I come home for over two years. They're so, so like. And he thought it was worth it at the time. I can't be proud. I think they they feel like.

01;21;56;05 - Unknown Interviewer: Larry thought it was a big letdown. Yeah.

01;21;58;25 - Bonnie Nellsch: And for, like, when he got back to the States and everything, there was a big deal. So you were in Vietnam. Nobody cared. There was no glory in it. Like in World War Two. All the guys were patted on the back. Maybe, you know, you were in World War two, so nobody acted like it was any big deal at all.

01;22;15;24 - Bonnie Nellsch: And especially now, I think you said since they pulled out, it's just, it was a big farce, you know.

01;22;22;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Do you think that people have some respect for, for them having. No.

01;22;27;17 - Bonnie Nellsch: No, no they don't. That's what they're griping about. It's because they got absolutely no respect for it at all.

01;22;33;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Have people even though people like, you know, make a big deal about it for some time, they might give the how do you think it was? Respect them? I don't think so. I don't think so. Because,

01;22;54;02 - Unknown Interviewer: If they ever talk about it just having an impact on their lives. Right. I think.

01;23;05;06 - Bonnie Nellsch: I know Larry did some work. High school said it affected him emotionally somewhat because, to go over there and see the guys all, shot off.

01;23;18;11 - Unknown Interviewer: And so especially when they first got back, I don't think it does now. Not now. They first got back.

01;23;25;22 - Bonnie Nellsch: Because he said, all the guys are getting over there and they get shot up and things and killed and so forth, and nobody cared. Just send them home. And then when they were all killed since war, nobody cared. What's that? There was no glory and nobody got paid.

01;23;42;03 - Unknown Interviewer: I hope.

01;23;46;06 - Bonnie Nellsch: that's the impression I get from my husband. Anyway.

01;23;51;03 - Unknown Interviewer: He's out here for such a long.

01;23;53;27 - Bonnie Nellsch: Oh, we haven't either. Really? But that's,

01;23;58;28 - Unknown Interviewer: That's really the. The first time I ever talk to anyone who hasn't been involved with.

01;24;05;13 - Bonnie Nellsch: With that war.

01;24;06;29 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, and even the others haven't been to. Seems like either who got left out somehow. But they have their father's house records, and the third person they really didn't affect. People are.

01;24;22;23 - Unknown Interviewer: One. Did you hear the fact? Oh, it wasn't a will for the people who live through it. It doesn't seem to be a real fun thing in their lives, right?

01;24;36;04 - Bonnie Nellsch: I don't want to know if anybody, during the depression that I've ever talked to except for, you know, mom tells us stories about how they had it when she.

01;25;07;03 - Unknown Interviewer: That's right.

01;25;08;26 - Bonnie Nellsch: Because she said that's where they lived. And they lived in a chicken coop at the time during the depression. And that's why she can remember so well, because they didn't have proper food. And she said she can remember once. In fact.

01;25;20;08 - Unknown Interviewer: They they shared that chicken. I think it was two families. Right. So I didn't of them.

01;25;27;12 - Bonnie Nellsch: For the farm. Dad would go out and we didn't have a car or anything means of transportation, but he'd go out every day looking for work, and there was no work. And that way there was no money, no food.

01;25;38;01 - Unknown Interviewer: And we raised the garden.

01;25;39;08 - Bonnie Nellsch: At that time, this was winter.

It was just simple food. But they sure thought it was great because they weren't eating much of anything. So it affected their can.

01;27;51;08 - Unknown Interviewer: They kind of got hit while I was here. I was.

01;27;54;19 - Bonnie Nellsch: Right. Well do you remember my mother's parents were transients more or less. They went from orchard to orchard and this is how they were living. So at the time it really hit them bad. Yeah. They like just more or less. So it really hit them hard where somebody like up here would be established, would like have their own farm or something new and natural.

01;28;16;01 - Bonnie Nellsch: They could live on what they had.

01;28;17;20 - Unknown Interviewer: Grandma, grandpa was telling me the other day that the they would have their own little garden, get by on your garden and you would walk in to farm.

01;52;07;18 - Unknown Interviewer: That's what I.

01;52;09;02 - Bonnie Nellsch: That's an experience right there. Especially if you're only 18 years old, you know, and, try to frame right by yourself. The friendliest person wasn't Diego Tremaine, and, he was, an employee at the airport, but now he was really nice. And now that was a complete experience in itself, because Negroes, in case you haven't noticed, are not in this area here.

01;52;31;09 - Bonnie Nellsch: I have, and they're not too welcome and never have been, although it's getting better, very little better, but a little better. So that was a real experience. And, you know.

And whether it's the abuse in the community that they get, which they probably do, not all people, because, I just don't believe that the whole town is against Negroes. But, quite a few people are definitely prejudiced.

01;53;50;24 - Unknown Interviewer: So I know, I know, my neighbor Carmen, and they had problems when we moved in. They knew right away that we weren't prejudiced against Mexicans, which we weren't. And I think that it was a musical family living there. I would encourage you to stay there. I never Hector came to this town. I don't think I would be.

01;54;11;02 - Unknown Interviewer: I wasn't up on the next place. But she has told me that many times. It's bad for crazy. People are prejudice and don't hire. If you work in town.
