What do you remember when it started out in that big old riverside building was. And it wasn't, but it for one of the top was sticking out all the water. One time we had pictures, but I don't think we have to long.

00;33;25;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Try to.

00;33;25;25 - Unknown Interviewee: Square up to that bridge row and that they wanted.

00;33;30;02 - Unknown Interviewer: To stand in there. Well, the dam that just broke last year.

00;33;34;16 - Unknown Interviewee: I used to think, well, but that riverside was around, you know, this building went wrong. What would be and it was a roller skating rink. And they had all these with a lot of big name band come there, like, you know, like, cowboy star, Ernest Tubb, those used to come out down at the dam to, and then everybody brush off their to cents, $2 a ticket.

00;34;07;03 - Unknown Interviewee: About one of them big bands. Were there. And Dennis and Jack and all those kids. And I believe that was even there when duty began again. I used to be out there to roller skate. We'd sit and wait for now, the kids don't have nothing here in the morning.

00;34;27;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Delivery for dairy, big bear, the line operation. Yeah.

00;34;53;23 - Unknown Interviewee: And, and yeah. But like back east, too much continued on. That was where there was a lot of ice skating. Skiing, man. You didn't have to go to a ski lodge to go school.

00;35;04;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Please sit down for a total I guess.

00;35;07;09 - Unknown Interviewee: You could go to.

00;35;09;05 - Unknown Interviewer: But we had a hospital and that would pay for, where they pay for your stuff or just for stuff? It's definite. The bill would take care of a.

00;35;18;14 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, now, you know, you've been here. They had medical service insurance.

00;35;25;09 - Unknown Interviewer: For her.

00;35;25;24 - Unknown Interviewee: And I don't know what that hospital was. The doctor's office building there. When we came in. We don't have a doctor, and we been down in that hospital office for that. But they had made the renovate.

00;35;38;23 - Unknown Interviewer: And they paid for. The family's over the roof. Yeah. I wondered, Chris, I was thinking how you had your kids at home, but it says the hospital. But then that situation was different, really, that everybody went to the hospital to have your children, you know, think of it.

00;35;54;02 - Unknown Interviewee: I had Jack and Jim at home. You know, when you come out and offer to go to the gym.

And she had such a high temperature from heartburn, they said, from, you know, coming up against the pelvic and oh, I couldn't be born, you know, that you got kind of like a brain concussion.

00;36;53;27 - Unknown Interviewee: Her she had a temperature of 108.

00;36;56;20 - Unknown Interviewer: Wow.

00;36;57;15 - Unknown Interviewee: You can just warm up like fish for a long time. Had to give her a bath and olive oil just in the water.

00;37;05;03 - Unknown Interviewer: It says it was cancer. Then I went to just then take it. It was here.

00;37;09;11 - Unknown Interviewee: No. when we came on here, Jeff was 14 against any of them.

00;37;19;11 - Unknown Interviewer: And when you think you were it, it.

00;37;21;15 - Unknown Interviewee: And Judy was only five. She.

00;37;26;12 - Unknown Interviewer: So she really grew up your whole childhood?

00;37;28;29 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah. She doesn't remember with, Judy. Therefore, she came in this out here. We and Jim work you the second grade. They came out here.

00;37;42;15 - Unknown Interviewer: Moving as kindergarten. Jerry said that he helped deliver everybody. What are you kids? But that one you want didn't live? Who didn't move? Yeah.

00;37;54;17 - Unknown Interviewee: There was. I had Jerry after Judy. He. He was from our age group. Oh, yeah.

00;38;04;16 - Unknown Interviewer: I mean, you know.

00;38;07;13 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah. Drama and all.

00;38;10;17 - Unknown Interviewer: That's what he had trouble with. So. Yeah, well, doing that.

00;38;14;25 - Unknown Interviewee: And then of course they didn't know that.

00;38;16;29 - Unknown Interviewer: Then we are.

00;38;18;12 - Unknown Interviewee: That out here.

00;38;19;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Greater now you can you. Oh you didn't even know that. oh. Excuse me in mind.

00;38;24;09 - Unknown Interviewee: what was wrong?

00;38;25;15 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, I been so it's easier to know.

00;38;27;17 - Unknown Interviewee: If they would have known. They could have just changed the front. Because you would have a perfectly otherwise.

00;38;34;01 - Unknown Interviewer: I can. I don't understand how they change the blood. Is that would. If your body is to produce that kind of food. Just take out the air. The body. Well now they have a soft. They can give you. Yeah. Your body anybody.

00;38;49;07 - Unknown Interviewee: And well I don't know exactly what have. Come on. No because I don't follow it too much now. But when they first started doing something about it they. Well, it sounds very negative. When she was pregnant, they checked your blood every month and they say when you get, they can tell when your blood starts changing.

00;39;12;07 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Because you take the antibodies after that move and.

00;39;16;02 - Unknown Interviewee: They would do it for serum. If you are enough. Usually it's about the eight months and all. They can do it for sharing and they take the baby then. Then it's all right. They can take it then. So far enough to be.

00;39;31;15 - Unknown Interviewer: You wouldn't eat. They didn't even know that. Well, puzzled for a long time. You probably had to play with that blood.

00;39;38;25 - Unknown Interviewee: That's what they had to say. They were just that just came out during World War Two. Oh, many of the soldiers that would get injured, you know. Well, then they would give them blood transfusions and they would help. Would you die.

00;39;54;23 - Unknown Interviewer: If it was the wrong.

00;39;56;01 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah. If it was, they might be given a time. But if that one didn't happen to be longer than they were giving it to a practice, then they would want them to. And when I had them after that, I had one stillbirth to.

00;40;15;15 - Unknown Interviewer: And now with that same RH factor.

00;40;20;11 - Unknown Interviewee: After Jerry died and I didn't know still then you know what that was. So when you get one more know.

00;40;27;28 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh.

00;40;29;03 - Unknown Interviewee: It was a baby girl. But at eight months I went into labor and, well, what happened is the afterbirth came off before I went into labor and that baby chicken all day, and I thought I was going out of my mind, you know, and I couldn't figure out what. It just kept going like that. My whole stomach,

00;40;53;23 - Unknown Interviewer: And I didn't know anything about.

00;40;57;22 - Unknown Interviewee: I never had anything like that happen to me. So I went on about my work, you know, and then I went to bed that night, and, God, the next morning I woke up and I was so sick to my stomach, you know, and I did, and I tried to get out of bed. And when I try to raise up and just like a big weight was on me and all, and finally I managed to get my feet out of bed and get set on my edge, you know?

00;41;22;28 - Unknown Interviewee: And after I couldn't get my head steady for a while, I could quit working, you know? And I get up on my feet, but I just knew something was wrong. But I didn't know why. So I decided, well, I get ready to go to the doctor. We had to go back 20 miles on the. And so well and all was back in and I had to go from white leg to an eagle.

00;41;46;11 - Unknown Interviewee: and I was about 20 miles. So I got ready and went over there and.

00;41;52;07 - Unknown Interviewer: The afterbirth had already come on, you know.

00;41;54;22 - Unknown Interviewee: Oh, Craft and Bird came off of you, right? And then all the blood went into you kissing ground, and that baby.

00;42;00;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Over there.

00;42;01;16 - Unknown Interviewee: And that's why it was just fighting. Always really grounding.

00;42;05;25 - Unknown Interviewer: For three in that.

00;42;08;00 - Unknown Interviewee: Horrible. When you think.

00;42;09;00 - Unknown Interviewer: In my, you don't know, it's so weird because it's like, well, I've never had a baby, but, you know, I know how to your body, but you don't know what's happened to 110.

00;42;20;16 - Unknown Interviewee: I went to the hospital and then the doctor helped me when I felt that baby there. And I used to go all day yesterday and never quit.

00;42;31;15 - Unknown Interviewer: And then I.

00;42;33;04 - Unknown Interviewee: Had to put me out. Go ahead and take the.

00;42;38;17 - Unknown Interviewer: Whole. Adverse event or so after the folks were there. You didn't have anywhere to visit. You're right that once again the search factor got into your blood right.

00;42;50;29 - Unknown Interviewee: See, I had heard before then is before you. Yeah. The more your body builds up against that said.

00;42;58;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Know, as I told me, that after the first one, it's the power of that.

00;43;02;16 - Unknown Interviewee: Then that's what they say. But they're improve or clean.

00;43;07;01 - Unknown Interviewer: For you exceptionally, you know.

00;43;10;07 - Unknown Interviewee: But from then on then I had Jerry died 87. So then I never could find out what was wrong. Oh.

00;43;19;12 - Unknown Interviewer: Really? Long time. Even though there are cubic arch factors. What that mean? It. Dang it. If you still that old.

00;43;27;25 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah. You know them. And so then you would Last and so one thing. But he ever found brown temperature cool and he wouldn't have any cold or anything. He put running time fever. Then I'd take him to the doctor and they'd put him in a hot, and they never could find out what was wrong.

00;43;49;26 - Unknown Interviewer: And we just didn't know.

00;43;51;19 - Unknown Interviewee: And then finally from that, the pool, when all the kids got the flu and then he got that, killed him.

00;43;57;21 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, the flu him.

00;44;00;17 - Unknown Interviewee: But he wasn't, you know, he probably would have always been something because like he would run on the temperature.

00;44;10;22 - Unknown Interviewer: So anyhow they would fix that up is all the child is older if you're.

00;44;15;10 - Unknown Interviewee: I don't know I'm sorry. He. Here. Yeah. I don't know how long I do, but, you know, this was only her second daughter and that was really bad.

00;44;29;29 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah.

00;44;30;20 - Unknown Interviewee: And they kept it there, and they closed with black. But if he kept it in hospital and.

00;44;36;18 - Unknown Interviewer: You never tried.

00;44;38;15 - Unknown Interviewee: To stick platinum, I didn't help, but broke home. And I used to deliver the paper to the kids. I went in for one day and she wanted me to be that purple color. That was the control room. It had the purple complexion, home kit.

00;44;59;00 - Unknown Interviewer: Court, be her.

00;45;00;19 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, because of that, and he had to watch it all the time to, show that after they change it blood. They probably have better methods. Now. This is long time ago. Like at grandma. Grandma where she.

00;45;13;06 - Unknown Interviewer: Very high all about dances with the blood. I don't.

00;45;17;01 - Unknown Interviewee: Know what made it that funny color and.

00;45;19;27 - Unknown Interviewer: I was.

00;45;20;26 - Unknown Interviewee: Horrified when I got it. I didn't say anything. Course you know. But when I look at my kids and my dad, that scared me to death, I said I would want to. Of that baby can be kept choking all the time on of death. But then it was all right after a while. After a while I thought it must take a while for that blood, you know?

00;45;42;12 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. What? How how they would ever help a child that had lived. Well, because he could be. Really. You could use blood in your whole body like when you big. They just made you take more.

00;45;55;11 - Unknown Interviewee: That's how you know. Well, but I know that's what they used to do. Would change all his blood. I think they took the plant and give it time and take point and give it time and, you know, a complete change. and, you know, I think what I can say about when I had that silver thing, I lost so much blood, you know, that they gave me blood for her.

00;46;23;28 - Unknown Interviewee: So it's a good thing you do with the blood.

00;46;27;00 - Unknown Interviewer: Why would you use a nine year old?

00;46;29;29 - Unknown Interviewee: And we from the plasma, I went right into shock and knew that that whole day after we didn't freeze to death, we were going to shock.

00;46;48;24 - Unknown Interviewee: That coming with death now, you know. But he was sitting there because he told them he came back up and.

00;46;57;13 - Unknown Interviewer: He this time, when you're in shock, You lose track of time, you know? I know everything.

00;47;03;12 - Unknown Interviewee: Going on and everything. But had that been whole blood, damn, it would have killed me to plasma. That man.

00;47;12;13 - Unknown Interviewer: You know, like all. Yeah, well, I sure glad he whole blood.

00;47;19;03 - Unknown Interviewee: But even.

00;47;20;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Though we.

00;47;20;28 - Unknown Interviewee: Know better now, you know, that's where they discovered it. Because all these guys were dying, that they gave me a transfusion.

00;47;28;12 - Unknown Interviewer: They'd have to check that. They'd check the blood and.

00;47;30;11 - Unknown Interviewee: Finally be discovered that that kill one was the same, but one was RH negative and one was very good.

00;47;38;06 - Unknown Interviewer: With the origin. They made it. It was somebody found it mounted. Or is it.

00;47;44;16 - Unknown Interviewee: Really.

00;47;45;07 - Unknown Interviewer: That what it is?

00;47;45;29 - Unknown Interviewee: That's what they are sure.

00;47;47;28 - Unknown Interviewer: Is was an extreme vetting of those that they found out.

00;47;52;12 - Unknown Interviewee: I don't know why they the best what it stands for me. Oh, wow. That's very, very true. And some people have that spectrum and some don't want them and they take it. And if.

00;48;06;06 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, if you don't have the fact that it's negative, then you.

00;48;09;18 - Unknown Interviewee: Don't have the RH factor thing. they're just a.

00;48;13;18 - Unknown Interviewer: Complete circle that you black lack.

00;48;16;26 - Unknown Interviewee: That you don't have, or they have.

00;48;18;11 - Unknown Interviewer: Things that exactly left.

00;48;20;01 - Unknown Interviewee: No, you're just different things in a different factor in the blood that the other blood does not have brought me.

00;48;28;03 - Unknown Interviewer: There quite a way that I don't. Did, it think these presentations were referred to, but doing interviews with their, their mom and talking about your work, her before my time, did you do any more work that you volunteered for?

00;48;44;19 - Unknown Interviewee: No, my kids were. That's when I was having. All my kids were small and nine year old, so yeah, I.

00;48;51;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Where they all born before the war.

00;49;14;25 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, he was always he would have been drafted, but he was always deferred because it was a crucial interview.

00;49;24;04 - Unknown Interviewer: Or did many women go to work in the mail because.

00;49;27;10 - Unknown Interviewee: There was a few work down there, but not to foreclose.

00;49;30;11 - Unknown Interviewer: The men did leave.

00;49;32;13 - Unknown Interviewee: There was apparently. Well, there were quite a few men that were gone from there, but they were younger men, you know, when drum was the right age. All right.

00;49;42;09 - Unknown Interviewer: However, it which is important you have you seen your.

00;49;45;05 - Unknown Interviewee: Name held in the Kirby.

00;49;46;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, probably because you wouldn't think it would be necessary. I don't know, for the war effort. So.

00;49;53;13 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah, just because of that, you know that he was deferred all the time. So he never did it here.

00;49;59;25 - Unknown Interviewer: That's the irony. So I was asked to go and shoot people.

00;50;06;29 - Unknown Interviewee: Take one.

00;50;07;29 - Unknown Interviewer: Day. Yeah.

00;50;09;24 - Unknown Interviewee: Oh, come in there from.

00;50;13;19 - Unknown Interviewer: One thing I found out that it was around here that they worked on the basket out here. Sure.

00;50;20;24 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, you know.

00;50;22;06 - Unknown Interviewer: Before we.

00;50;23;01 - Unknown Interviewee: Move, there used to be houses, I guess. All down. Know where that field is. You know that later. Married. And then they were all.

00;50;33;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Put the concentration. Care for them.

00;50;36;01 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah. I don't know if they took them all over here and put them in. Okay. I don't know. Account information. Can. But there was all kinds of Japanese here before we can.

00;50;47;12 - Unknown Interviewer: Order the August from the area.

00;50;49;03 - Unknown Interviewee: There wasn't any here when we came, but people said that that used to be all houses down in there. And the Japanese, all of that heard there was a lot of Japanese people around.

00;50;59;22 - Unknown Interviewer: So why would you why did they come to this area?

00;51;03;25 - Unknown Interviewee: I don't know. Oh, no, I think that I think that they they took them from this area and put them in camp.

00;51;10;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. See there.

00;51;13;22 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, now some people, like my brother, read what is one of the quaint manor we always call him Red kitchen. That red hair. Now, he was him and my brother here for broken. More World War two.

00;51;31;11 - Unknown Interviewer: They survived.

00;51;33;06 - Unknown Interviewee: yeah. I mean, one never got a scratch, but my brother Red was. And me and herb was in the army. I wouldn't put them both in the same thing, you know, because they were.

00;51;43;23 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh. Oh, well, so, I don't know, drink three. But,

00;51;50;13 - Unknown Interviewee: They couldn't. Both going to the same apartment.

00;51;53;19 - Unknown Interviewer: Maybe just because your brother.

00;51;54;23 - Unknown Interviewee: Usually because they were from Fort Wayne, they couldn't both be in the same.

00;52;01;19 - Unknown Interviewer: I think you were thinking ahead of the field before that kind of.

00;52;05;10 - Unknown Interviewee: And so my brother read. He thought that he was on a destroyer, and he would talk with the Japanese and, you know, a half of the Navy stuff in one spot. It was right at Pearl Harbor, you know, which most people didn't know because they team wanted to know that we were that far down, you know, that we would come so close to losing that war.

00;52;33;11 - Unknown Interviewee: And, anyway, they had all these suicide planes that I know you ever heard about in the Caribbean. And, my brother read his, a ship was down ships. He said they just come at you over 100. And he said it was so crazy because those guys, you know, playing cricket left.

00;52;54;12 - Unknown Interviewer: And like crazy. And they knew they.

00;52;56;17 - Unknown Interviewee: Were dying because they crashed right into those ships. And 715.

00;53;01;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah.

00;53;02;25 - Unknown Interviewee: And anyway, he said this, this blood was so thick on the ship, they would go from their ship out to the metal ship to try to get the guys off and say, what the could this be? Was LeBron like, yeah, let's go back. And they had to take they had this big boat, Turkish town, and they had to roll it out ahead of them and crawl on their hands and knees.

00;53;27;16 - Unknown Interviewee: It was so slick. you know, that blood, they couldn't stand up. And then they'd get them into the lifeboat and then die half of them before they could ever get to that big ship. And all the tiny, crazy suicide planes were coming out. And he says he didn't know he couldn't possibly live through that because he said they were falling all around me.

00;53;49;01 - Unknown Interviewee: And just like flying.

00;53;50;14 - Unknown Interviewer: The planes or. Yeah, in.

00;53;52;22 - Unknown Interviewee: The paper dying, you know, where that was hitting them, shooting them. and anyway, he said when they came home and when the war on the border, he used to sit and laugh and laugh and cry and cry and, you know, he was doing it, but he couldn't stop crying.

00;54;15;00 - Unknown Interviewer: Really.

00;54;15;11 - Unknown Interviewee: He said all the kids were scared to death then made. All right. Yeah. The kids on a ship. But he finally got on right when you got home. He didn't do that after he got home, but he told that later that he thought he was really going up.

00;54;30;23 - Unknown Interviewer: You know, being from there.

00;54;32;16 - Unknown Interviewee: You crawling on your hands, you know, and like, you know, you and all the wild people dies in action laughing and crying. It'd be like.

00;54;42;22 - Unknown Interviewer: An insane nightmare. All right.

00;54;45;12 - Unknown Interviewee: But, and my other brother, sure, he went. And he had the horrible pictures, but he took over there. That's where they piled all those Jews up. And he poured burnt. And you know, he's got pictures of the dead people, that he took em down.

00;55;06;11 - Unknown Interviewer: So he knew about it. But a lot of people in.

00;55;08;12 - Unknown Interviewee: Germany, they.

00;55;09;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Didn't know that.

00;55;10;03 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, see, they were marching in there and they were running ahead of them. And a lot of times they just called the big fires thing was, try all this before the Americans got in there, too. But he took pictures. When he heard that, he took him down. And the people, there's cute little kids and everything and their arms and legs is big round.

00;55;33;27 - Unknown Interviewee: You know, their stomachs were great. You know, if they are to there is any bloat in there. Right there. Why don't. Oh, God. It took a couple.

00;55;44;22 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah.

00;55;45;14 - Unknown Interviewee: He never showed me no pictures till about 3 or 4 years after he'd been left. Called about. May be out of service, you know, and probably war would go over. He couldn't. But then he showed us how terrible that really graphic.

00;56;01;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Cuz I don't.

00;56;03;21 - Unknown Interviewee: Really want crying. I don't know if he ever saw that. Let my people go. They come back and it showed always. They had big trunk. They throwing old people in here. The big great big hole was bulldozed and they throw those people down the trough and put them in that big hole. Cover them up.

00;56;21;26 - Unknown Interviewer: Early. Poor, horrible.

00;56;23;06 - Unknown Interviewee: It was all, you know.

00;56;25;02 - Unknown Interviewer: There was everything for the.

00;56;26;22 - Unknown Interviewee: Polish people that they made work on. in their war factories. Yeah. And then they wouldn't pay the money to starve to death, and then they'd have another whole bunch of them for those in big power. Them not.

00;56;41;02 - Unknown Interviewer: So easily. Yeah. It isn't. You can't hardly believe it.

00;56;45;28 - Unknown Interviewee: You weren't really there.

00;56;47;15 - Unknown Interviewer: And I like to think that since women give birth to children, that they wouldn't want to do that kind of killing. You leave the word from the dead. But who don't?

00;56;56;24 - Unknown Interviewee: I can't understand that. But I it and like my brother that read did that and then he really thought he was going crazy. Crazy. Did he just sit there and laugh, laugh and cry and kind of did enjoy doing it? But he couldn't.

00;57;12;14 - Unknown Interviewer: Stop? Yeah, probably because his nerves.

00;57;15;18 - Unknown Interviewee: Were so bad sequencing all that, that he just got to the point where he couldn't. It's a good thing that was over. He probably would have went in insane, you know, from there.

00;57;27;01 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah.

00;57;27;26 - Unknown Interviewee: Because I think your body and mind can just take on much horror and then you just can't.

00;57;34;15 - Unknown Interviewer: You can't eat anything real horrible happen like that, you know.

00;57;38;24 - Unknown Interviewee: No, you.

00;57;39;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Either. You. I'm lucky you.

00;57;41;09 - Unknown Interviewee: You're him telling you those things you said. You can imagine what it's like having all those planes coming down. And all along he said it was so crazy. They were just laugh and,

00;57;55;04 - Unknown Interviewer: I don't see how they could train.

00;57;56;22 - Unknown Interviewee: Those Japanese to be. Well.

00;58;00;25 - Unknown Interviewer: I probably they have a whole different culture way of looking at things. Could be thought for a country I don't know, I yeah, well, that is the way they did it.

00;58;09;11 - Unknown Interviewee: And, they were taught to be happy to die for their country readers.

00;58;16;26 - Unknown Interviewer: But it was so I can't imagine anyone thinking that way. I wouldn't.

00;58;20;24 - Unknown Interviewee: You know, it's hard for me to think that you you could get in there a point and know you were going to certain death and dive right into those ships.

00;58;29;11 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, you were killing other telling people. Well, thank you, family of you. You were too affected out here. Are you in Idaho? They did they watch for production?

00;58;40;11 - Unknown Interviewee: No, We didn't. The war was over when we came back.

00;58;44;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, 40. No.

00;58;46;08 - Unknown Interviewee: It was over. And for you, what?

00;58;47;24 - Unknown Interviewer: It was going,

00;58;49;20 - Unknown Interviewee: The and I, I think me down on the coast and stuff where the workers were. And you'd be seeing more of that.

00;58;58;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Or if you wanted people.

00;59;00;24 - Unknown Interviewee: Right back over for years before that, when there were talked about the war experience before they could. Yeah. And then after that along, well.

00;59;14;20 - Unknown Interviewer: Your parents moved out here. They came and you said it was.

00;59;18;28 - Unknown Interviewee: In 42.

00;59;20;24 - Unknown Interviewer: So once a year. So the twins say they were fascinated with, you know, they came over here, went to school.

00;59;27;04 - Unknown Interviewee: And married.

00;59;28;00 - Unknown Interviewer: To their.

00;59;28;24 - Unknown Interviewee: Friends. Congratulations. They were 18. We had to go right in the war. but it's.

00;59;34;27 - Unknown Interviewer: oh had an excuse to have.

00;59;37;22 - Unknown Interviewee: They didn't have any choice. They were drafted right into that service as soon as they turned 18.

00;59;44;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Three and the Oregon. So you tried to figure it out?

00;59;52;07 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, yeah. But it's you know, it's hard for you to think of. Well, you've been worth my life, but then I think that involves the whole country.

01;00;04;18 - Unknown Interviewee: You know, these other wars haven't been, now, Jack was a little bit more, but, he was on a destroyer in Maine back in 1952. And, that was when the Korean War was over.

01;00;25;27 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. That's what you said about you.

01;00;28;01 - Unknown Interviewee: No, no, no, he said that they had been destroyed or took ship for our ships and they would go into the coast, the short a Korean and blow up, like, oil. stockpiles and things like that. And that one time they just went off shift and the next front because it went in and took their ship or dump.

01;00;54;04 - Unknown Interviewer: All you really was looking for. I really got my more.

01;00;57;18 - Unknown Interviewee: But then he came back to this.

01;00;59;08 - Unknown Interviewer: Place.

01;00;59;23 - Unknown Interviewee: And he. Yeah, was like, my brother read to them too. They'd have to go find those islands, you know, when they put those over here and they'd take the ships and go foreign. He kept the Japanese one for, of course, and they were shooting as they were coming ashore. And so they just fell all around. And but he never.

01;01;22;16 - Unknown Interviewer: Ever was here because one of the things we wondered out of some people read it and some people didn't know we got, I think.

01;01;31;13 - Unknown Interviewee: That one time again when they went ashore, I don't know what column that was on that one. Which one at work that they went ashore on. And he said that when they go ashore and got done shooting the Japanese, that they program up like caught with a long offshore.

01;01;57;10 - Unknown Interviewer: Stack before that kind of communication.

01;02;01;02 - Unknown Interviewee: I don't know why you pile them all up like that. And they came down in a big trench and dumped them all into what could it? But he was just telling me they can't believe it. The amount of people that was killed, I guess, you know, you read in the paper and stuff, but he said if you were to have to be there any one time.

01;02;22;14 - Unknown Interviewee: They went ashore and they took care of local Japanese, you know, they wouldn't surrender. Japanese never would surrender. You know, they let down and, I don't think they ever would have surrendered if it hadn't been for those H-bomb states over here. that was the.

01;02;43;13 - Unknown Interviewer: First thing.

01;02;44;09 - Unknown Interviewee: That happened. That was the only thing that made them worry about. They would never give up just fine if they wouldn't. They had something like that. I don't think they would ever give up until the last one more time. But anyway, they went ashore this time and they had been there. They had to take their stuff in, and they'd have to go through all these caves and get them out of there.

01;03;06;05 - Unknown Interviewee: Otherwise they'd shoot them when they went to sleep or something. You know, so they'd have to go in and clean out all these caves to make sure it was no more on them. And they would come off. They would tell them, you know, I'm going to surrender. And come out, and they wouldn't even do it. So then they throw a grenade in there.

01;03;26;10 - Unknown Interviewer: For you.

01;03;27;21 - Unknown Interviewee: And they'd throw a grenade in there one time. And outcome this little kid stagger and all the after and all the rest were dead in that this one kid come staggering out and they had to take their kids with them. A little boy and one time this woman that she. Me.

01;03;46;17 - Unknown Interviewer: Let me go over to them, put.

01;03;48;28 - Unknown Interviewee: Them down to the shore.

01;03;50;25 - Unknown Interviewer: To get rid of them. And they hollered.

01;03;53;14 - Unknown Interviewee: At her, I'm called channel. And she wouldn't. And she kept right on coming in here. She was kind of baby in her arm, and she had one hand behind her. So when she got pretty close to him, she wouldn't hold they or and she had a hand grenade thrown in amongst them. She was going to walk up to them and try.

01;04;17;12 - Unknown Interviewee: And then they had this baby.

01;04;20;00 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh baby, there's.

01;04;21;20 - Unknown Interviewee: No.

01;04;22;13 - Unknown Interviewer: Better care of the baby.

01;04;23;16 - Unknown Interviewee: Where they had to take it along with them. So they come very.

01;04;29;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Nice to go.

01;04;30;15 - Unknown Interviewee: To hell with it. Yeah. And it was so funny. None of them would ever do well. They had to kill him. Because when they'd come to kind of take and stuff, they just hoped to stay in there. So they throw Canadian and you couldn't walk in, you know, because it was a horror. We couldn't see what was in there.

01;04;56;05 - Unknown Interviewee: They didn't know whether they had machine guns or some of them did. Yeah. And they would shoot at it.

01;05;03;08 - Unknown Interviewer: Incomprehensible. But I don't think it could ever be together.

01;05;07;23 - Unknown Interviewee: You know, they. I don't I don't think, I don't think, I think it was I think they all all think of.

01;05;21;28 - Unknown Interviewer: I mean.

01;05;22;15 - Unknown Interviewee: I think.

01;05;22;29 - Unknown Interviewer: They were.

01;05;23;21 - Unknown Interviewee: Them, they just captured or pulled in to and made a mark in there and that's it.

01;05;30;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Mama. And what I do know.

01;05;34;03 - Unknown Interviewee: They just kept working until they'd get so skinny. You know, they when you see them an image or burn them up, they'd starve to death. And some of them, they took him to be, camp and told.

01;05;47;17 - Unknown Interviewer: Them he to keep either.

01;05;50;15 - Unknown Interviewee: I hope I'm not scared you that to death. No, I'd be scared to death over years ago. But this this really true thing that.

01;05;59;24 - Unknown Interviewer: Was in 45.

01;06;01;19 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah. Oh 41 I believe it was over and all the 45.

01;06;06;19 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. Because then very soon after the war, my sister was born. In a while we did, the 51 I was in the second round, the baby boom. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So you guys had been married for a few years over for a kid? Is. Oh, I hope I don't have to live through anything like that.

01;06;35;18 - Unknown Interviewee: But I hope not. But if they ever have another one, it'd be worth me being married. Probably. But they have nowadays. It's.

01;06;42;23 - Unknown Interviewer: It's strange, the stuff they have now that I've grown up knowing. Like I don't plan ahead for more than five years because I just had this idea in my mind that everything he doesn't blow up do you think like that, that it could just,

01;06;56;18 - Unknown Interviewee: Oh, well, I think the reason that there's got to be going on here, maybe.

01;07;03;17 - Unknown Interviewer: in World War two.

01;07;05;00 - Unknown Interviewee: Depending, yeah, that that was another war. You can't get around that. Look how exciting. All right, I know I was required to read the old oil price.

01;07;20;10 - Unknown Interviewer: To.

01;07;21;10 - Unknown Interviewee: Right now. And. If those Arab countries don't get the United States, the oil, they're going to think of military as you.

01;07;36;18 - Unknown Interviewer: So, man, like the Kissinger like, how did you say I didn't do you say that again? But supposedly he's all these talks of peace, but he's the first one to mow this thread, so there'll be war over that. So why don't.

01;07;51;18 - Unknown Interviewee: They cut off?

01;07;54;13 - Unknown Interviewer: This. I was asking for it to put the idea in their hands.

01;08;00;05 - Unknown Interviewee: Because they have all this terrible stuff for, well, that bomb that they put on Japan where they were nothing compared to what you have now. And look what that first tried.

01;08;17;11 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah. It's so calming. All that stuff and then all the money that they've done killing things and then I'm sure this money would have spent on things like, ABC or food stamps, do they raise the price of food stamps. So they do that.

01;08;34;12 - Unknown Interviewee: So well or, Look at when we have a war. What I can understand, they go over there and they blow all these countries like Japan to bits, and then they only ever take government, build them all up in other countries. And they're they're practically the top one of them. Is in this economy and stuff. They put all those factories in there.

01;09;04;09 - Unknown Interviewee: They give them all that fat. Go ask the Japanese on practically everything up there.

01;09;12;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Really? yeah.

01;09;13;19 - Unknown Interviewee: That, balances, paternal orders and things and that, who is the big meal up there?

01;09;22;28 - Unknown Interviewer: And if it weren't for oil.

01;09;24;22 - Unknown Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. And they're all gone to Japan.

01;09;28;23 - Unknown Interviewer: I think it's crazy. There is exchange for oil there. They're trading nuclear, information. Yeah. Like putting them oh. So crazy. And there should be more valuable things than bombs. They could do bombs in Tehran.

01;09;48;02 - Unknown Interviewee: And it just shaped what it is now. It's so crazy mixed up that you can't even sort it out. Yeah. I mean, they'll tell you, like, you know. Oh, yeah. Big and gas shortage or the big gas shortage. Then, you know, when it comes to creation time, it did. Now everybody go on your vacation. Just go plan your trip.

01;10;06;21 - Unknown Interviewee: Go to plan. There's plenty of gas. And then they were making them stay open Sunday. Can't get on our where the hell did it all come from all of a sudden? If it was so short just the week before, then they got the place up where they wanted it, then there was enough then. Now they're hollering again. Honestly, now they're talking again, quoting another 9 or $0.10 on it.

01;10;29;08 - Unknown Interviewee: So I think it's just some kind of a big political gimmick. Crap. Yeah. And then there's sugar. Now, you know, there's there's sugar in all the stores, all you can buy if you got enough money to buy it.

01;10;40;07 - Unknown Interviewer: Yeah, that for sure wasn't a.

01;10;42;10 - Unknown Interviewee: Real no added sugar last summer was $5 and something for that. not 13.5 up to $14. Yeah. It's now slowly dropping a little bit more.

01;10;56;29 - Unknown Interviewer: More. But powdered sugar or commercial pilot as a kind.

01;11;03;20 - Unknown Interviewee: Well, brown sugar I buy that to bake with a mango dollar $0.44 for 3 pounds or 2 pounds. I don't know which one.

01;11;12;22 - Unknown Interviewer: It is, just reduced like they the price of it is. No, a little bit. They think it's better, but really it's still a lot higher than one.

01;11;21;17 - Unknown Interviewee: It's just getting ridiculous and close. Great.

01;11;28;03 - Unknown Interviewer: And I don't buy clothes because over.

01;11;32;06 - Unknown Interviewee: Blouses you're going to store you need to pay like $5 or $20 for blouse 1416 to go.

01;11;41;29 - Unknown Interviewer: You haven't shop for clothes recently.

01;11;45;17 - Unknown Interviewee: I took the train down my well, I'm doing coke.

01;11;49;09 - Unknown Interviewer: Can you see the coke?

01;11;51;05 - Unknown Interviewee: So I took him down and that's where we were.

01;11;54;02 - Unknown Interviewer: Oh, if you had a shopping.

01;11;56;26 - Unknown Interviewee: And I had a lot prettier coke, I thought, take it up. They want it. And, chemical was $36 on sale. You know, they're having all the sale. Oh.

01;12;09;14 - Unknown Interviewer: After Christmas.

01;12;10;06 - Unknown Interviewee: January sale and truly were $48. And then they marked it down to 38. Now, then.

01;12;22;13 - Unknown Interviewer: They kind of left.

01;12;23;25 - Unknown Interviewee: You know, they're not that good. A couple put.

01;12;28;03 - Unknown Interviewer: There seems like that's a fashion amount function. But I think where.

01;12;33;20 - Unknown Interviewee: You are beginning the year, I want to get them a good blow. Yeah.
