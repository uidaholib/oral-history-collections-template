    "description": "The history of the Silver Valley, Shoshone County Idaho reads like a dime novel with MURDER, MINING, MAYHEM, MEN, MONEY AND PROSTITUTION!  Many of the Mining Laws of 1972 were written from the court cases filed in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. The military highway through the South fork of the Coeur d’Alenes opened the territory to prospectors and adventurers. Wallace and the Silver Valley are mining camps, the railroads came because of the money to be earned shipping ore concentrated to the smelters.  The industry has evolved with the changing times, environmental regulations and the communities are ready to continue their sustainability with changes as well. Shauna moved to Wallace in 1980, because the wind does not blow here!  Wallace is the best small mountain town where a person could reside.  It is on the Interstate 90 corridor, near to Spokane, Washington, and Missoula, Montana.   (If one must go to the city.)  It is  in the middle of mountains, rivers, hiking trails and  outdoors sports. She finds the history of the Coeur d’Alene Mining District, Shoshone County and the railroad transportation fascinating and surprisingly modern.  She is curious and an avid reader, of all kinds of topics. It is a pleasure to reside and work in Wallace as we define ourselves as a mining camp, a tourist destination, a trailhead on crown jewel bicycle path, and a hometown.",
