So I guess we're talking about the electoral college and, why we have it and why people are so concerned with the fact that we still have it, which seems to be a pretty popular topic. Certainly since 2016, but really since 2000. You know, when I first started teaching American government back in the late 1990s, when I would be teaching my intro to American Politics course and talking about the Electoral College, you know, students would kind of tune out because they think, well, this is just this archaic thing, and why do we even care?",

And that was the first time that that had happened since 1888. So, got a lot of renewed attention. And then certainly that same thing happened in 2016.",

So that got even more renewed attention on this debate about the Electoral College, and maybe it was time to get rid of it. And so the idea behind the Electoral College really comes from the framers of the Constitution wanting to insulate the presidency from the popular will, and also to give states a role as states in the selection process of the president, because federalism and defining states as their own, you know, political entities is a very important component of our constitutional structure.",

It's that and not that there aren't good arguments to do away with it and never have an election where the president, you know, got 3 million, less votes than, you know, the person who lost.",

And so there was indeed a very difficult question. So why as as Lori pointed out, there were there were competing concerns and, and we could start with the fact that the framers could not have adopted the, the system most familiar to them, and that is having the national legislature select the president, which would, of course, closely resemble a parliamentary system, as that practice in England.",

      "speaker": "David Adler",
      "words": "And there were really two reasons why the framers couldn't embrace, the selection of the president by the national legislature. One is that the framers were constantly worried about corruption. They were worried about cabals. And they feared that, in fact, if the national legislature had the authority, it could result in a lot of mischief and intrigue, people plotting, to place their own person in the white House.",

      "words": "And that would always keep the president looking over his or her shoulder. But but the second reason and really, the the more striking reason why they couldn't adopt a, a method by which the national legislature selected the president was because the framers had already decided that they were going to implement the separation of powers doctrine.",

Some of the real heavyweight in the in the convention, by the way, embraced the idea of a popular vote, including James Madison, James Wilson and some others.

But the fundamental reason, as Lori knows very well, why the framers could not embrace a direct popular vote, was that the framers were concerned that the American voters might not be able to cast wise decisions, particularly because they would lack information about the various candidates, and they would be essentially, grasping for a candidate in the dark.",

And so the framers feared that a direct election might lead to state favoritism, regionalism, sectionalism, and that would cause a lot of strife. And and so, the framers finally stumbled upon, this idea of the Electoral College, which would give, state some authority and, provide for, a method that the framers hoped might place in the power of decision making.",

And I'll throw this to to my colleague Lori, what if the convention, or the country rather at that time did have a USA newspaper or a New York Times that hit every state in the Union or NPR, do you suppose that the reasons why the framers, opposed the direct popular vote would not have been factors had we had better communication?",

I mean, I think that's one of the best arguments for doing away with the Electoral College is that one of the main reasons is that, well, people just, you know, they didn't trust the average person to, to take part in this, but really, they weren't even talking about the average person at that point in terms of who had access to vote.",

Debate on why it is still in use rather than the popular vote is very present from the general population. Comments such as “outdated,” “anti-democratic,” and “arbitrary” fly around as critiques against the institution. Join us as we discuss the history of the electoral college, if it should remain, and the mechanics behind the scenes. This program is funded by the 'Why It Matters: Civic and Electoral Participation' initiative, administered by the Federation of State Humanities Councils and funded by the Andrew W.
