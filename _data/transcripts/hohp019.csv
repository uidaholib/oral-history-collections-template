Rita Padilla Perez,[00:00:21:69],[00:00:33:60],Rita Padilla Perez. I was born 1930 here in Idaho Falls. Do you know when your family came to this country?,idaho;family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:00:34:35],[00:00:41:67],My father came in 1911. What state did he come to?,family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:00:42:57],[00:00:53:20],"Texas, but he did not stay there. I believe he went on to San Francisco. And what was the reason that he came to the United States?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:00:55:10],[00:01:09:90],A dream of coming to a rich country where people could easily make a lot of money. Why did he move from Texas to California?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:01:11:00],[00:01:20:50],"Where he could find work. I believe he worked mostly with the railroads. So wherever he took him, that's where he went. And how long was he in California?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:01:23:50],[00:01:39:59],"Up and on, I believe until 1925. Would he be in California and stay the whole year or would he just work a season and go back to Mexico?",mexico
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:01:41:64],[00:01:51:90],"He went back to Mexico three or four times, but then he'd come back to wherever there was work. And was it always California?",mexico
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:01:52:87],[00:02:04:04],"No, he went as far east as Illinois. Working for the railroad? Working for the railroad. And when was the first time that he came to Idaho?",railroads and transportation;idaho

Rosa Rodriguez,[00:02:11:28],[00:02:43:80],"I believe they came contracted by the sugar factory. And did he ever work in the railroad when he was in Idaho? Yes. Yes, that is. One time he had worked from Pocatello sent to Alexander near Soda Springs, then to Bancroft and Fort Hall and Blackfoot, St. Mary's. When did your mother come to the United States?",labor;railroads and transportation;idaho;pocatello;food and drink;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:02:45:42],[00:02:59:15],"1925. No, 1924. She came right after they were married. And did they come directly to Idaho or since your father had been here since 1919?",idaho;family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:02:59:71],[00:03:01:24],Did they come directly to Idaho?,idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:03:01:75],[00:03:19:25],"No. First they stopped in Arizona to visit my father's sister who lived there, but it was in July and they could not stand the heat. They went to San Francisco where my father had a brother living. And then they came to Idaho?",family;idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:03:20:09],[00:03:43:03],My mother was a country girl. She couldn't take city life. My father had to work night shift all the time. Her health deteriorated to the point where a doctor told my father he had to get her out of the city out in the country that she was accustomed to. So they were saving for the trip when my father was laid off. They were saving for the trip to Idaho?,family;health;idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:03:47:57],[00:03:52:47],And how did they come to Idaho by train or?,idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:03:52:90],[00:06:05:93],"Yes. They came by train. How much did it cost for them to come over? I don't know, but my mother said that my father only had enough money. There was only enough money for one. To pay fair for one person. My father proposed putting her on the train and then bombing himself, meeting her here. She was petrified at the thought of traveling alone, not knowing the language. So when he left to take care of final business, she caught her hair that was done to her knees off and pulled a cap over her ears and put on his clothing and overalls. When he returned, he was a gust to the point of tears. And she just gave him an alternative. Either she'd accompany him or he could take her back to her parents' home. So he brought her with him. Do they ever tell you how long it took them to come to Idaho, the length of time it took them from California to Idaho? No, I can't remember my mother ever telling me, but she did say that they walked to the outskirts of San Francisco where they, quote, boarded a train in the dark. They had no problems until they got to the train over the salt lakes in Utah when a conductor caught them and he wasn't about to believe that she was this man's brother. And I told my father to tell it to the authorities in Salt Lake. It's a good thing he had to tend to his work, gave him a chance to get off the train and hide under the bridge until night when everything was no sign of life or danger of getting caught again. And they walked clear to Ogden, walking at night and hiding, sleeping during the daytime. Why were they hiding?",family;health;clothing;idaho;food and drink;environment;recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:06:06:31],[00:06:23:81],"Why were they... Because they were afraid that if they tried to catch a train again in Salt Lake, the conductor might have warned the authorities and they would be looking for them on the trains. Because she didn't have a ticket or because she was a woman?",food and drink;recreation
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:06:24:83],[00:07:11:56],"Neither of them had a ticket. Oh, I see. And they were afraid they would be separated. So they came to... He brought her to Idaho Falls in 1925. And he had already been living here since 1919. He had not been living here all the time. Just off and on. Off and on when there was work. When there was work with the railroad and the sugar company. And the potato harvest. And the potato harvest. What did... Did your father find a job right away when your mom came with him that first time?",idaho;railroads and transportation;agriculture;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:07:12:72],[00:08:33:37],"When they came here to Idaho, I believe they had been living in town and he was going out to work on a farm in Ammon to Thimbeats. So then when... When it was time for my brother. Due time for my brother to be born. They had talked to Ammidwa but he had to go bring her. He brought her and he was going to go off to work. They had to work when there was a chance and Ammidwa said, Wait a minute, you are staying here. Or I go. My father wanted to go back to work and do what he could when he could. He said, You are going to stay here. This is your first baby but it won't be your last. There is going to come a time when you will have to know what to do. So my father had to stay and she taught him. Told him why she did everything she did and using sterile technique. And he did use good sterile technique better than some Dr. Sanders that I saw. So it's a good thing she did. So your first brother was born? Your older brother was born?",idaho;family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:08:33:91],[00:08:35:58],Yes. And what year was that?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:08:36:27],[00:08:45:32],"June 9, 1926. Was there other Mexican families there in Idaho Falls?",mexico;idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:08:46:77],[00:09:05:51],"Yes, because they had told them about this midwife. The midwife was Hispanic. Yes, an elderly very Indian woman. I see. So then did your parents use the midwife for all of the children?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:09:06:72],[00:09:14:84],"Where were you born, Rita? Were you born at home also? Yes. And so how many of your brothers and sisters were born at home?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:09:15:89],[00:09:17:60],How many are you in your family?,family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:09:18:13],[00:09:59:32],"There are, well now there are only 15 living since one of my sisters died recently. Just November 1, 1989. So there's three older boys, Anay, Cecil, Denny, Sandra that died, Julian, Adolph, Alex the first, Adolph the second, Alex the first, Alex the second. Twelve were born at home. Twelve were born at home. And when did your mom start having her babies in a hospital?",health
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:10:00:44],[00:10:21:65],"Joseph was born in 1944. We were living at a labor camp, Taichi, out of Pocatello. I see. And all these other women started telling her all these horror stories about a woman who had died in birth, and she got two hands, I think, to be able to have a baby naturally. What was the name of that labor camp again?",labor;recreation;pocatello
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:10:22:44],[00:10:36:72],It wasn't the labor camp. It was just the owner of the store had a little park there and had cabins. We rented a cabin. But then a lot of other people came and pitched their tents in the little park he had there in the center. Were there a lot of Hispanic people there?,labor;recreation
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:10:37:67],[00:10:40:74],And what year was that that Joseph was born?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:10:41:15],[00:11:04:70],"1944. 1944. So how many of you live in Idaho Falls still? Most of you live in Idaho Falls? Most of us. One sister lives in Boise and the one that died lived in Oregon, and Joseph lives in Pocatello. So the house where you were born, Rita, where was that house?",idaho;family;boise;pocatello
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:11:05:10],[00:11:09:25],"On Fremont Avenue, where the home is now. And you still have your home there?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:11:10:08],[00:11:27:01],"Does someone still live in that home? Yes, my two bachelor brothers. You two older brothers live there? They just recently, the city demanded that the old house be demolished. Oh, and they have to... Oh, it has been demolished. It has been. When was that?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:11:28:13],[00:11:46:37],"Just this last year, in the fall. So how... So when your father moved here with his wife, with your mom, in 1924, moved here to Idaho and moved here to Idaho Falls, did he come to live in that house?",family;idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:11:46:82],[00:11:57:15],"Was that their first home? No. No, they had been renting somewhere near the riverside. By the river?",idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:11:57:62],[00:12:11:41],"No. Between the river and the tracks, where... For the senior living center east. I see. About J .J. or K Street. And how long did they live in a rented home?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:12:12:89],[00:13:27:05],"Until 28. They bought... Well, they had bought a lot on K or J Street and started building, but he did not have money to complete the building, so the fire department made him cut up the frame and told him to move it out because he was going to be there. Because he was a fire hazard. A man that he used to work with told him that there were lots out near the river that he could buy and didn't even have to make a down payment. The owner would settle for five dollars down and my father would have to pay the property taxes. So they cut up the frame. Five dollars down for a down payment and a lot. Great. Sure, but they didn't even make a dollar a day then. That's true. So they had to cut up the frame that he had put up for this house on K or J Street and move it to that place over there. It was just like a sand dunes with a lot of piles of garbage here and there. And he built... Did he... He's the one that built the house? Your father? So he... They... They put the frame together the best they could there around that place. Who is they, Rita?",art;family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:13:28:12],[00:13:32:82],And this co -worker of my father's that had helped him about those lots. A friend of his?,labor
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:13:33:24],[00:13:42:22],Yes. And he helped him build the home. And you lived and you lived with your brothers and sisters and your mom and dad there for how long?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:13:43:27],[00:13:46:65],When was the house demolished?,

Started building it in 1965. No, 1960. You just added on or you built a new house? No, an entirely. Totally new house. With a basement and brick. The older house was behind the shop that my brother built later. Do you have pictures of your house?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:14:23:20],[00:14:24:15],Of your first house?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:14:24:48],[00:15:13:24],"Yes. That your dad built? Yes, my sister and brother took pictures before it was totally demolished. How many other families, Hispanic families, lived in Idaho Falls when you were born or when you... As long as you can remember. As far back as you can remember. There's two or three. Two or three families? They used to live here. There used to be a lot of Hispanic families that used to come from southern Idaho, Texas, California, New Mexico, Colorado, but they did not stay. They would just come to pick green peas and stay for the potato harvest. Some of them wouldn't even wait until the potato harvest was over when it got too cold for them. They left. And where did your father work?",family;idaho;mexico;agriculture;health
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:15:13:75],[00:15:15:10],Did he work all year round?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:15:15:62],[00:15:35:25],No. I remember in 1936 he came over joy because the neighbor had given him a dollar for working all day cleaning up thick pans. I see. So he had to work at odd jobs. What was the main job that he did?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:15:36:41],[00:16:01:15],"Farm work started with thinning beets, hoeing beets, then we would go to drinks and pick green peas. Come back about mid -September and pick potatoes. And after the potato harvest was done, if there were any sugar beets to harvest, then we'd work at that. And when you went to Drix, how old were you?",agriculture
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:16:02:58],[00:16:10:41],The first time I can remember I was four going on by. And how many brothers and sisters did you already have?,

Rita Padilla Perez,[00:16:32:72],[00:16:39:13],I would stay there for probably about six weeks. And where did you live?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:16:40:39],[00:16:52:62],"They had a place, a clearing in the forest where we were allowed to either pitch tents or build shelters out of bark. How many other families worked there?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:16:53:46],[00:17:28:48],"Quite a few. There were three or four families that we knew quite well. But there were probably about eight other families. Hispanics. So was that a self -made labor camp type of a...? No, I believe the contractor made arrangements to our work. And there were a lot of people to camp. To camp out there. What was the name of your contractor?",labor;recreation
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:17:29:00],[00:17:34:94],"James White. And he was the one that would find those jobs, for instance, that job picking peas?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:17:36:86],[00:17:49:75],He'd contract with the farmers and then he would provide all the labor. How did he communicate with your father if your father...?,labor;family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:17:50:44],[00:18:02:01],My father spoke broken but very understandable English. And so you lived there for six weeks?,family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:18:03:66],[00:18:06:07],"And did you ever work there, Rita?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:18:06:38],[00:18:08:24],Did you ever help your mom and dad?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:18:08:74],[00:18:16:38],"The first time that I worked out in the field, I was about eight years old. And what did you do before you worked out in the field?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:18:16:96],[00:18:20:46],Baby theater. You took care of your little brother and sisters?,art;health;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:18:21:44],[00:18:24:00],And your three older brothers worked?,

Rita Padilla Perez,[00:18:28:05],[00:18:29:96],And then you would stay in the tent?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:18:30:48],[00:18:47:14],"No, they would take us in the car or truck and park it at the end of the field, where my mother could come at intervals to check on the baby and nurse them. How old was the baby when you took care of her?",recreation;family;health
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:18:47:50],[00:18:55:07],"Well, the first time I was left in charge, my younger sister, she was about six weeks old. How old were you?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:18:55:72],[00:21:34:53],"Not quite five. And so how long did your... What was a normal working day for your mom and dad? How long did they work that you had to take care of your son and sisters? One rice to sunset. Tingling beads could be from four o 'clock in the morning to nine o 'clock at night, picking green peas because it was under the contractor and he said the hours, it was from six to six probably. And so then you went there how many years to Drix to pick peas? As far back as I can remember until 1945, I believe. Tell me a little bit about how your parents picked the peas. Also, it would be nice to know how much the contractor got paid as part of his wage. I have no idea what the contractor got paid. I think that we might have been paid about three cents a pound. And was it in barrels or what? How did your parents... They had wooden baskets that were kind of cylinder shaped, starting with about eight, twelve inches at the bottom and coming up to twenty -four or more inches at the top across. So, kind of, maybe if you could describe to me your first memories of Idaho. My first memories of Idaho was home. My father always planted a big garden, the nine lots we had. I remember walking out the door and the squash were in bloom. I thought it was beautiful. I had no notion as to states. You didn't know there were other... No, it was just a very small world. Just... Idaho Falls. Not even Idaho Falls. It was just when my first recollections was just home, the lot, the fence around it. Outside that fence. So then, did you have neighbors?",health;labor;idaho;family;agriculture;recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:21:36:03],[00:21:42:90],"Yes, but they were not friendly, to say the least. Why were they not friendly?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:21:44:16],[00:21:45:59],What was it that they did?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:21:46:64],[00:22:06:09],"Oh, discrimination. We had one neighbor that during the Depression, my parents raised chickens and... my father to give him a hand and my father said, no, you're getting help. We're not getting any. What do you mean by the neighbor was getting help? What does that mean?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:22:06:81],[00:22:28:46],"Welfare. But we... because my parents were Mexicans, we were Mexicans. No help for Mexicans, he was told. I see. During the Depression. So, you're this neighbor who was getting welfare, wanted my father to give him a chicken and my father said, why should I give you a chicken while you're getting welfare and this is all we have?",family;food and drink
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:22:32:83],[00:23:12:55],"So, he... burned our chicken coop. They found a tire. The fire had been started on a tire and there were rags with gas on them and... called the fire... the neighbor across the street called the fire department and helped my parents carry buckets of water to throw on the house... to keep the fire from burning the house that we lived in. And the fire department came but they wouldn't do anything. They just sat there, they're sitting. They wouldn't stop the fire? No. So, my parents and the neighbor carried buckets of water. So, how were you treated?",food and drink
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:23:13:53],[00:23:16:16],"Like, for example, you would go to the grocery store?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:23:17:07],[00:23:30:90],"I don't know because we were never taken in the grocery store and we were children. My father went and got the groceries, that was it. Your mom stayed home? Yes. And your father never talked about the way he was treated?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:23:31:61],[00:24:41:27],"No, never. Never said anything about how he was treated in the grocery store. Or in any other place. Would he also go... how... what kind of clothes did your mom sew for you in your clothes or did you buy your clothes? No, my mother sewed most of our clothes and... first. Well, at the time... would you say that maybe there would be maybe one grocery store and... Describe to me Idaho Falls at that time. All I can remember is that on the way to work there was a blacksmith shop where... Saving Center is now on Memorial Drive. There was a... the park body is now the parking lot was more like a dump, a lot of piles of garbage and hitching posts. I believe White Star Landry was already there across the alley from Saving Center. But, like on a Sunday, a typical Sunday, did you have to work? Did your parents work on a Sunday?",family;idaho;recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:24:42:00],[00:25:02:74],"Yes, when they were working for an individual farmer, they sat there on hours and they worked from sunrise to sunset when there was work to be had. Well, especially in this area, Rita, the people, the religion that's dominant here, they don't believe in working on Sundays. Why is it that you worked on Sundays?",religion
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:25:04:07],[00:25:30:88],"The farmers that we work for most... well, I don't know. I know one farmer used to kill my father. He'd be a good Mormon because he had so many children, but... I mean, he was free to work when there was work to be had. They never told him he could take time off. Did you go... did you go to church, to a church service on Sunday?",family;religion
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:25:31:35],[00:25:42:55],"No, there was no church. My parents, we prayed at home, but I didn't know where the church was until I was 22. Until you were 22. And where was the church?",religion
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:25:44:56],[00:25:50:59],"Oh, so they had a church built. What religion would that be, Rita?",religion
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:25:53:22],[00:25:55:27],When did they build that church?,religion
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:25:55:96],[00:26:24:68],"I believe it was built in 1944. 1944. That's the new one. There used to be a church, a kiddie corner from where the church is now, where the school is. The playground is now. Tell me, if you could describe to me your first days of school, what were they like?",religion;education
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:26:25:79],[00:26:28:07],Did you start school in kindergarten?,education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:26:28:48],[00:26:29:07],Was there a kindergarten?,

Rita Padilla Perez,[00:27:00:20],[00:27:38:00],"Well, my uncle came in 1934 and convinced my father to go to California where there was work to be done. As it turned out, the only work my father could get was picking citrus fruits, and it turned out to be allergic. He'd get a rush all over and he'd have to get under the citrus fruit trees. So he had to fight another job. So some co -workers told him there was work in Imperial Valley picking green peas. So after that, we started going to Imperial Valley and onto Bakersfield where there was work picking green peas again. And when would you come back to Idaho?",family;idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:27:38:90],[00:28:11:11],"When the weather got so hot, my father couldn't stand it anymore. One time about mid -March, he went and picked us up in school. With a truck already loaded. Head for home. It was always exciting. It must have been always exciting. Yes, we were like gypsies and always looking forward to see if we should have our friends we would see again. In the different towns that you moved in. Well, now tell me, how was it in the first grade in that school?",family;education
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:28:12:25],[00:28:12:81],In California?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:28:13:88],[00:28:26:79],"Not bad. Mostly we were segregated and there we were just Mexicans, no Anglos that I recall of. They had festivities. Why were you segregated?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:28:28:61],[00:28:36:57],"I think it was the norm at that time. So then what, you would go to a different school than the white students?",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:28:37:98],[00:29:10:29],"Well, I remember that there were no Anglos there, just Mexicans. And the school that you were in? That I went to. When your father first registered you in school in California, did he go to the right school he should have gone to or did he go to? I think we were just sent with our cousins. Were there a lot of Hispanic students there?",education;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:29:10:68],[00:29:27:92],"Oh yes, there were. Only Hispanics. And no other race? No other race. There were no blacks there. Tell me, so you were in school in California in the spring or?",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:29:29:25],[00:30:21:59],"Mostly in winter, just winter and maybe part of spring until work started. So tell me your first memories of going to school in Idaho. How old were you and what grade was that? That would be still the first grade, wouldn't it? It was still first grade. But I think I had learned enough English probably that I was not aware of. And even though you don't understand the language, you get the message. But when we were in Idaho Falls and we were the only Hispanics at Riverside School, then it was either... You learn to swim or drown, so we learned English because we were the only ones that spoke Spanish. We had to learn to speak English. Were you accepted well in the school?",education;idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:30:22:53],[00:30:25:70],"Yes, we were. Did you have a lot of friends, Rita?",

Rosa Rodriguez,[00:30:50:61],[00:31:25:07],"No, we started school after the potato harvest and the meat harvest was all done. There was no more work to be had. We started school. Sometimes we didn't start until mid -November. But would that be in Idaho or in California? Either place, wherever. If we went to California, we started school there. We were not allowed to work in the fields, so we had to go to school. So we started school there. When we went there, there was nothing they could do before we moved there. So you missed a lot of school while you were growing up?",education;agriculture;idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:31:25:44],[00:31:27:98],Yes. Did you graduate from high school?,education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:31:28:57],[00:31:39:29],No. I just went to the fifth grade. But your younger sisters and brothers did graduate?,education
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:31:40:14],[00:32:09:98],"You were the one that had to help support your family? Well, all the older ones had to work to help support the whole family. So Danielle was the first one to graduate from high school. What was it like for you when you had to leave school here in Idaho and go to California?",family;education;idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:32:10:50],[00:32:28:83],"Tell me how it was. Well, we didn't have to leave school here because we were not in school. If my father decided to go to California, he didn't even enroll us in school here. When there was no more work to be had, we loaded up and left for California. But you didn't have to leave school here. But you had told me that you had started school here?",education;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:32:30:05],[00:32:47:85],"Well, actually, the first year I went to school was at La Habra School in Orange County. But I can't remember too much. It's very hazy. And then I did go to school here. What was the name of your—who is the best teacher?",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:32:48:48],[00:32:54:44],Who would be the teacher that you would remember the most in your life?,education
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:32:57:61],[00:33:02:40],"Well, I teach her ahead in Gonzalez, California. And what was her name?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:33:05:20],[00:33:15:66],"I can't remember just now, but she was very good. So then you're telling me that you went to school in California more than you went to school in Idaho?",education;idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:33:16:31],[00:33:47:94],"Yes, because the only time I went to school here in Idaho was the winter of 3940. And then... 40... 5. That's the year that we were going to go to California. They didn't get the truck fixed in time, so my father decided it was too late to go to California. So we started school after Christmas vacation that year, so we went to school here in Idaho. And was that a good experience for you?",education;idaho;family;labor
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:33:48:81],[00:34:06:00],"It often does, too. It's life's reality. Did you have a language problem when you went to school here in Idaho?",education;idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:34:06:51],[00:34:22:73],"I know that in California, most of them were Hispanic students. Did you have a language problem here? Well, we had to learn English at school because we did not speak it at home. Was that hard for you?",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:34:24:09],[00:34:28:28],No. I think we took everything in strike. And your brothers also?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:34:29:03],[00:34:32:94],"Well, my younger brother had a problem one time. Did he?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:34:33:38],[00:35:44:61],"Go ahead. He had had a teacher, Ms. Moffat, that was very kind and understanding, you know, the circumstances, but she had a heart attack. One time my teacher sent me with a note to the principal's office at sixth grade. And here it was coming. Cecil's teacher had insisted that he stand up and say something in England, say something. Cecil was reluctant, but she insisted, made him stand up and say something. So he said what he knew. And so she was carrying him off the floor by the hair to the principal's office. I walked in behind her and Mr. Bush, who was the principal, told her, Ms., you are punishing the wrong person. She looked very perplexed. I stood up and looked at the classroom. I said, all right, boys, all of you who have been teaching Cecil, stand up and apologize to Ms. Webb. They had been teaching him behind the schoolhouse. They had the wrong things, huh?",education;britain
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:35:46:61],[00:35:50:03],"Well, tell me, Rita, how much education did your parents have?",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:35:51:61],[00:36:58:30],"My father was kind of a spoiled kid. His father was wealthy, too. My father was very restless. He got expelled from school. And they hired private teachers, and all of them gave up when my father and they finally hired an elderly man to teach him that was giving my grandfather good reports. But by and by, my grandfather happened to come along, and he was my father, pasturing the professor's horse. So that was the end of education for my father. My mother did go to school to third grade, but in Mexico, third grade amounts to about tenth grade here. They're more advanced in Mexico? Oh, very much so. When your father was in Mexico, was that during the Mexican Revolution?",family;education;wildlife;mexico;conflict
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:36:58:88],[00:37:08:21],"Yes, because he was born in 1891, so. And does he ever talk to you about the Mexican Revolution?",mexico;conflict
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:37:08:88],[00:37:24:40],"He didn't, but he did talk to my older brother. I see. My mother told me some of the experiences they had. So did his father, your grandfather, did he fight in the Mexican Revolution?",family;mexico;conflict
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:37:24:92],[00:37:30:48],"No, he was so well -to -do, so money talks anywhere. Oh, so he didn't have to?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:37:30:82],[00:37:52:01],"No. Because he had money. And, well, not only money, but he also had authority. He was very good with the quip with a color, chirrion. He could handle anything and anybody. How was your father, your grandfather, well, to do? What did he do?",family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:37:53:36],[00:38:24:15],"He had land. And farming? Well, he had people taking care of the land. All he did was collect. I see. Talking back about education, Rita, how have education opportunities for Mexican Americans in Idaho changed in your lifetime?",agriculture;health;education;mexico;idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:38:24:90],[00:39:11:53],"Greatly. First thing, the economy increased, I mean improved very much since the depression was over. And then we grew up and stayed together, so we managed to talk my father into allowing the younger ones to continue school and not have to take time off. Was that hard for you to convince your father to not let your little brothers and sisters go to work? Well, I think we kind of gave him the alternative that if he didn't let the younger ones stay in school, what was the use of us staying home to help support them if they weren't going to get the advantage of it. And so then they graduated from high school and went on to college?",economy;family;education
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:39:12:80],[00:39:24:73],The younger ones did. The first one that graduated from college went to work at the concrete plant. I see. Do you think that Idaho's Mexican Americans do well in school?,mexico;education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:39:27:21],[00:39:35:38],"Some, but I think that a lot of them still have problems. What kind of problems do you see?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:39:37:46],[00:39:50:78],"In different teachers and parents that don't care. And the teachers, they don't care? Where are they?",health
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:39:52:48],[00:41:03:53],"So many of them don't care because I remember once when one of my brothers was having problems in school and sent a note home wanting to talk to our parents. Well, our parents would never bother to go talk to the teachers or to PTA meetings. I got the note, but I couldn't. That's when my mother's appendix had ruptured. I was in charge of my mother and two -month -old baby and the whole family. So I asked my sister to go talk to the teacher. My sister went to a third grade classroom. The teacher was starting to get her own master's and expected to just give an assignment to third graders and let them do the best they could with it while she studied for her own interests. My younger brother didn't know how to read and we didn't know it until he started junior high. And the only reason we knew he didn't found out was because he had always been very good in math. And then he comes home with a report card with a U in math. So my older brother and I questioned him, hey, what's the meaning of this?",health;education;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:41:04:05],[00:41:04:80],What are you doing?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:41:06:82],[00:41:22:09],"And he said, well, I don't understand this. So he brought out his math book. And here was the problem. A farmer had so many apple trees. He harvested so many bushels of apples from all of them. How many bushels did he average per tree?",food and drink
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:41:22:92],[00:41:55:44],"He would have had to read to solve the math problem. And he did not know how to read any word more than two syllables. So we taught him. He didn't understand the problem -solving story, Kelly. So, Rita, what was your first job? I know that you had to take care of your little brothers and sisters while your parents worked in the fields. What was your first paying job?",health
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:41:57:09],[00:42:09:48],"In the kitchen at the old Sacred Heart Hospital. Did you work in the fields with your parents before you? Oh, yes. But that money went to the family?",religion;health;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:42:09:94],[00:42:19:48],"Yes, that went to the family fund. So that really would have been the first time you went to go work. How old were you when you went to work in the fields?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:42:22:19],[00:42:30:36],"As far back as I can remember, we had to pick the vines off the potatoes. How old were you then?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:42:32:09],[00:42:36:50],Six. About six. Did you work a whole day?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:42:37:17],[00:42:49:11],"Oh, yes. A whole day. And when your parents got paid from the farmer, did they get paid cash or check?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:42:50:34],[00:42:58:59],"You should be a check. A check. And when you were at Drix, you went also to help them when they went to go pick peace in Drix, Idaho?",idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:42:58:96],[00:43:07:46],Yes. Were you also working a whole day over there? And were you six years old then also?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:43:08:63],[00:43:44:09],"I was left to babysit and I didn't work out in the field picking green peas until I was eight. Until you were eight. Tell me, describe to me a day, a typical day in Drix, Idaho, after your parents would come home from work, were there... I don't remember if you told me how many Hispanic families there were over there at the same time you were... About twelve altogether. Did you all get together?",idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:43:45:25],[00:44:29:30],"No. No, we... I think the men did visit a lot, but the women had their chores to do. Well, tell me about, you know, where you washed your clothes, where your mom washed her clothes. Oh, they dug a well. But in Drix, you didn't have to dig very deep to get water. Beautiful, clear, good water. So they dug a well and we had to dip a bucket in to bring the water up and build a fire outside, place stones to hold an old galvanized washing tub. So that's where we had to heat the water and then... Did the families share that water?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:44:31:32],[00:44:46:78],We... several families shared that well. How about six families shared that well and somebody else dug a well farther on. Was there only Hispanic families there or were there others?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:44:47:55],[00:45:11:67],"There were also Filipinos and Anglos, but they kind of went off to different corners. So then when... it was time for like a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday, because you didn't work on Sunday at Drix, you did work on Sunday in Idaho Falls. What was that like on a Sunday?",idaho
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:45:12:51],[00:45:24:21],"Catch up on the shores, do the washing and mending and ironing. And did your parents visit with the other neighbors?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:45:24:88],[00:45:46:01],"Oh yes, they would come. There were two families that were particularly close, and my mother enjoyed their visiting with them very much. Especially one family was from my mother's hometown, so they could always reminisce about old days. She had someone to talk to, another adult. How many years did you go to Drix?",family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:45:47:84],[00:46:01:01],"I don't know how long before I could remember, but from when I can remember in 1935 to 1945. And did your father go to Drix by himself before you started going, before you were born?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:46:01:53],[00:46:18:30],I don't know. You don't know that. Did you ever have to celebrate Cinco de Mayo or Dia de las Madres or anything like that?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:46:19:03],[00:46:47:69],"I remember one thing. We were still in California on the harbor in May, and celebrated Cinco de Mayo at school. But it was just activities at school no more. I was referring to your family. No, not our family. Did you ever, at that little area in Drix, did families come together and have a dance or party?",education;family;recreation
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:46:48:67],[00:47:48:36],"No, the other families had, a lot of others had a dance just about every Saturday, but we were not allowed to leave the area where our shelter was. We'd climb up on top of the truck and watch and listen to the music. Who was we? You and your... My brothers and sisters. My brothers and one sister at the time. Rita, can you tell me if your father worked in the railroad here in Idaho? Yes, but he worked on the railroad off and on, everywhere from Pocatello to Black Food and St. Mary's, New Ashton. I think you told me that earlier on the tape. How long, what was the length of time that he would work?",recreation;art;family;railroads and transportation;idaho;pocatello
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:47:48:82],[00:47:50:48],How many months or how many days?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:47:51:19],[00:48:08:34],"I think he had taken his vacation to work on the potato harvest, but then he was laid off for good when the depression worsened and for the discrimination, so he was one of the first ones to be laid off and after that it was strictly harm work. When did he first start working in the railroad?",labor;agriculture;railroads and transportation
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:48:09:48],[00:48:35:46],"I think from the first time he came to the United States. In Idaho would be the first time that he came to Idaho? I think in Idaho might have been 1925. 1925? I'm not sure. So then the depression of the 1930s, you were born in 1930, and then the depression hit and he lost his job in the railroad?",idaho;railroads and transportation
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:48:36:01],[00:48:39:21],Yes. Did they tell him why?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:48:40:36],[00:48:53:96],"No, but if he was fired when he had seniority, they didn't have to give any excuses in those days. So he had been working there longer and yet other people didn't get laid off, he did?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:48:54:26],[00:50:07:28],"Right. So was that harder for you? Obviously it was because it was during that depression, but was he always able to find work in the farming community? He was a good worker and so he always found work if there was work to be had. You probably couldn't tell me very much about the depression, but maybe if you could remember what it was like, you know, if you struggled or if your parents had a hard time bringing in food into the home. Well, yes, like the winter of 1936, 1937, I remember there wasn't any money. We just had vegetables from the garden, potatoes, turnips, carrots, onions, but no money for flour, not even for oats. A nine pound bag of oats cost nine cents and we didn't have it because my father didn't have nine cents. Well, did you have chickens and eggs?",agriculture;labor;family;food and drink
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:50:08:82],[00:52:19:42],"Well, we had had before 1934, before we went to California, but they sold everything they could sell and then came back to the house. The walls had been wrecked because my father left it to be used for any poor people that had no place to stay and they knocked off all the plaster of the walls and it was all greasy, dirty, filthy. So we had nothing but our little check in the middle of the nine lots when we came back and that was all dirty. They had to scrub with lye and even that wouldn't bring the grease off the walls, wooden walls. So that year, that winter of 1936, 1937, there we were with one of my brothers who was born on December 5th and we had nothing but like I said, we didn't even have beans. There had been some beans that we had been saving to feed two chickens or a pig come next year, spring, but my mother got those beans because she was nursing the baby. We stayed with the potatoes and other vegetables and my father used to go to the butcher shop and ask for bones for the dog, which we didn't have. And he boiled the bones in with the vegetables, which gave him a little more substance until he swallowed his pride again to go and ask for more. But then a Mexican man, family that the farmer had let them plant all they wanted had planted Mexican corn and he came and offered it to my father. My father said, yes, I can use it, but I don't have any money to pay for it. And the man said, oh, it's just as well. You said, leave it there for the mice too. We eat it. If I come back next year, you can pay me. So we had cornbread and corn porridge. That made life a little better. During the Depression, were your neighbors worse off than you?",family;food and drink;wildlife;mexico
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:52:20:23],[00:52:54:42],"No, they were given welfare, but we were not eligible for welfare because we were Mexicans. And so then did your neighbors share with you? No way. The best they did, a neighbor across the street had pigs. He hired my father to go and clean the corrals and take him a dollar for a whole day's work. My father was delighted. He came home with a bag of flour and a bag of oatmeal. And did your neighbors tell me a little bit about your neighbors during the Depression?",family
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:52:55:44],[00:53:00:73],Did they treat you well for you being one of how many Hispanic families?,

Rosa Rodriguez,[00:53:17:65],[00:53:55:34],"They picked on us a lot. In fact, it was later in the winter of 1939 -1940 that we stayed here in Idaho. We had a dog. His name was Moreno. My mother used to let him loose just about that time. It was time for us to be coming home from school. And so the neighbors were afraid of the dog, so the dog went to meet us at school. So then they didn't pick on us for fear of the dog, but they eventually killed him. Did your neighbors, would they come and visit you?",idaho;family;education
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:53:56:44],[00:54:49:11],"No. No, it was pretty much everybody stayed on their side of their fences. So it was one of those times during the Depression, and one of the neighbors across the alley wanted my father to give him a chicken. And my father said, why should I give you a chicken? You're getting welfare help, and they won't give us any. Well, the neighbor was mad enough that he put our chicken coop on fire, found a tire and some rags, soaked in gas. So we know he must have been the one, because he was so mad, because my father wouldn't give him the chicken. So he put our chicken coop on fire, but the neighbor across the street helped my parents carry back some water to throw him the house. So the house wouldn't burn along with the chicken coop. Well, did you have a fire department at that time?",family;food and drink
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:54:49:84],[00:55:06:13],"Oh, yes, the neighbor called them, but they just came and sat there jolly visiting from my parents and the men carried buckets of water. Did you, so were the chickens lost?",
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:55:06:69],[00:55:31:57],"Yes. They were all dead. Tell me about your transportation. What kind of transportation did you have here in Idaho Falls, for example, when your dad would have to go get the groceries?",idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:55:31:92],[00:57:09:44],"What did he use? The first time I recall, we had a Willis -Knight car. It had been quite fancy. It had velvet upholstery inside, and I remember how my younger brother and I used to have great fun picking dried green peas and filling those great big pockets on the doors with dried green peas. And then when that car gave out, my father traded in for a one -ton Dutch truck, and he built kind of a little box on the back that we were putting in. So that was kind of a part of our home when we went camping in California. So those vehicles, were they the kind that you had to crank in the front that you had to? The car, yes, but I can't remember my father having to crank the truck. So your father must have worked very hard, and you worked very hard in your older brothers, to be able to have a form of transportation. Well, it was essential. There was no way of getting around, especially with discrimination. There was no finding a ride with anybody else. It had to be self -sufficient. Tell me a little bit about your older brothers.

How were your, how did your father manage when they were at war, when they were gone? He felt very bitter because the fact that when he went to ask for help to buy food for us, he had been told nothing for Mexicans. But when a war came, then the Mexicans who were good enough to go risked their lives. So what were your brothers? Were they in the Navy?",conflict;family

And he had been saving all his weekend time off to come and help the family with a potato harvest, but come potato harvest time, he was on a ship for Korea. Well, does he have, did he ever talk to you about whether there were more, you know, Hispanic soldiers apart from him, or?",family;agriculture
Rita Padilla Perez,[00:58:31:46],[00:59:26:94],"Well, not so much with my older brother. He had joined the Army. But then my other brother joined in 51, and he said there were mostly Hispanics. He said there was a shipload of mostly Hispanics bound for Korea after three months of training at Fort Ord near San Francisco. But then General MacArthur said he gave the order he did not want anybody with less than six months training, so then they were detoured to Japan where they got another six months training. My brother said that without those six months training, they would have been dead ducks at the war fronts, battle fronts. Rita, can you tell me the first time that you actually started working in other areas aside from working in the fields?",family;labor;japan;conflict
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:59:27:96],[01:01:10:86],"Yes, I went to work at the indication at Sacred Heart Hospital. And while working there in the kitchen, they noticed, they had noticed that there was a class, training for practical nurses was going to be starting soon. And so I went and asked the sister in charge, and she asked me about my education. And since I didn't have a high school diploma, she advised me to go work in a nursing home, and maybe between that and taking a GED test, I might be allowed to get into training program. So I went to work in a nursing home, and one of my work co -workers told me by and by that there was a program by the state paying, offering to pay for training because it had such a shortage of nurses. So I went and took the test and passed it. And while I was working there, I had taken time off to help with the harvest, and when I came back, they had admitted a lady just a couple of days before I came back that they were having problems with. She was Swedish and tried to insist that she did not understand English and was refusing to cooperate. I was assigned to take care of her. And sure enough, when I walked in and greeted her, good morning, and she jabbered off something to me that I did not understand.

That was in the nursing home, and I did take the test and passed it, but I still had that GED to take. And after about three months into training, the training program, my supervisor told me that they still insisted that I had to take the GED test, so she provided transportation to Pocatello so I could take the test. I guess I learned enough helping my brothers and sisters with their homework to pass the test. How old were you when you got your GED?",education;labor;pocatello

At one time I was almost discouraged to the point of giving up, but then I thought since my instructor had gone through all that trouble, the least I could do was hang in there, and I made it. So I worked there at the hospital, LDS, after I graduated. So you worked at the LDS hospital. Was there a lot of patients there that were Hispanic? Did they need your ability to speak both languages?",labor;health

Rosa Rodriguez,[01:02:57:23],[01:05:14:80],"One of my classmates had avoided me, like I had something contagious, and that's when we were still students, and our supervisor could see it, I guess. We had instructions that usually we worked with two students in each department together, and we were not to ask any of the other nurses for help. If we had a patient that we needed help with, we had to ask the other student before asking anybody else. She assigned this other woman to, student to, care for a patient where she would definitely need help. I noticed that she was kind of very reluctant, just hanging around and peeking in, so I finally asked her if she needed help. She admitted that she needed help with the patient, so I went and helped her. Our instructor, I think, followed, they had always given this woman patience that she had to have help with, and she had to swallow and ask me for help. And invariably, we got to know each other, and I guess she came to us at me. Then after we were done with training, we were offered a class in psychology, and it came out that she had grown up in the area around Lincoln, the sugar factory. And she remembered when they had the camp of Mexican families there to work on the sugar beets, and the children, she was a child, and the children loved the music, and were very curious about the comings and goings of the Mexican people, but their parents had warned them to stay away because Mexicans say children, so she had always had that fear and apprehension of being around Mexicans. So then we could understand why her reluctance to be anywhere near me or accept me until we worked together. And you got to know each other. We were all good friends. So you were an LPN at the hospital. How long did you work in the hospital?",health;education;labor;recreation;mexico;family;art
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:05:16:13],[01:06:50:84],"I worked until 1965. We got a new director of nurses, and from the time she came, she was kind of breathing down my neck, and maybe some other patients had complained because I've never been one to push my religion on anybody else, but so many of them do, and they would always ask and try to push their own, and I tell them to wish his own. You have yours, I have mine, and I guess they didn't like that, and I was told and warned I was not to discuss religion with the patients, and I sensed that there were some of the nurses were maybe appointed to spy on me because I could always see them kind of sneaking near the doors. And eventually I was fired, not for talking religion, but for informing a patient of her rights. I found her crying her head off one time, and she couldn't even stop crying. She couldn't even talk. I just sat there with her until she calmed down, and she told me that the doctor insisted she had to have a surgical procedure. I told her, like, hell, you do, it's your body, and you do or don't do whatever you want. If you don't want a surgical procedure, you don't have to have it. So they found out I had been there and assumed that I was the one that had advised her to do what she pleased, and so I was fired on the spot. So what did you do after that?",religion;health
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:06:51:92],[01:07:26:05],"Did you file agreements against the hospital? No, at that time there was nothing that I could do, and so I just, it was in summer, so there was a lot of work to be done at home, and I was uncertain what to do, so I just stayed at home and did gardening and canning and made clothes for my sisters. In the meantime, I got called to, they needed an LPN at the Sacred Heart Hospital, so I went to work there. And that was the Catholic Hospital?",health;religion
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:07:26:40],[01:07:57:36],"Yes, and I stayed there until I went to work, quit there to go work at the Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. I enjoyed working with children more than with adults. Well, Rita, so you got your high school diploma, and you obtained an LPN certificate. Your other brothers and sisters, did they graduate from high school and go on to college?",health;food and drink;recreation;education
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:07:58:00],[01:10:51:52],"Just the younger ones. Danny was the first one to graduate from high school, but then he went to work at a concrete plant. Julian did go on to college, well, Fendra, that's next to Danny, who died recently. She went on to college in Oregon and got her teacher's degree and taught all her life after that, until just shortly before she died, and Julian got his degree too, and he's an insurance salesman. And then Adal was too restless, but he went to night classes, and he's a pipe feeder. Alex did go to trade school, electronics, he's now working as a fireman. Joseph went to college. Not a major in agriculture, but he's a bus driver at the side. All the three younger girls went to college and got their degrees for teachers. Margie had studied Spanish in college and wanted to be a Spanish teacher, but she even went to Mexico with a college group and spent one summer there and came back, and there was an ad in the paper for a teacher to teach Spanish in the junior high school, and she applied for the job and was told she did not have the qualifications necessary. So, she went back to college and got her master's. And then, in the meantime, just before she finished there, there was an opening for an instructor to teach the blinds, so she went to work for the National Federation for the Blind, and she worked for that until she got married, just shortly before she got married. Now, she helps her husband in his business, and the youngest one of the girls, Lupe, went to Holy Cross Hospital in Salt Lake and got her a degree there, and he's working at the emergency room. I think she works in surgery now. And Tony, the youngest, went to trade school and learned, studied welding, and he taught at the trade tech here in Idaho Falls for a time, but now he's working as an engineer and now in management at the site. At the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. You had two other brothers that passed away when they were babies?",education;health;agriculture;mexico;family;religion;food and drink;recreation;manufacturing;idaho;railroads and transportation
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:10:52:22],[01:14:15:97],"Yes, the first one was six months old. Was he born here in Idaho Falls? He was born in California, Altavista in Orange County, and he came to Idaho. One day, my mother given him his bath, and he went to sleep, which he usually did, but then one o 'clock he had wakened up, and so my mother went and tried to rouse him, and he was not responsive, so they took him to the doctor. The doctor said there was nothing wrong with him. He was just teething, gave him some teething lotion, but he got worse at night. They took him to the hospital, and the doctor said the baby had double pneumonia, and he was very angry that the doctor, they had taken him to earlier, and that they hadn't done anything else, and that was the time before antibiotics, the doctor told him. And was he your, one of your, how old were you when he died? Eight. So he was one of your younger brothers. And then the second one that died was born in Gonzalez, California, 1941. He was the most loving baby, very smart. And we came to Idaho and returned to California following winter, the next year. We were living in a labor camp in Madison, in an armitent. The weather was very cold and rainy, and he got the missiles, and he seemed to be coming along fine. We used to have blankets hanging in the bed, around the bed in the corner to keep him in semi -darkness. One time he, it was, like I said, rainy weather and cold, and we didn't let him come out of that corner. I have to stay with him most of the time, but he was such a jolly, loving baby. It wasn't too much. But then one time he fell asleep, and I went out of the corner and was washing diapers when it was raining outside, and there he was standing in the doorway, laughing like he had outsmarted me. Well, he got kind of feverish that night, and got sicker the next day. He was unresponsive. But when my father talked to him, he'd always break out in smiles, like his old self, and it wasn't until he got so sick that he wasn't responding. They couldn't rouse him. Then my father grabbed a blanket and ran to the car with my mother and my older brother following, and he died on the way to the hospital. On my sister's birthday. That must have been very hard for everyone. But then she had her first baby girl on her birthday, so that made it okay. Rita, what kind of responsibilities did you have aside from taking care of your brothers and sisters?",idaho;family;health;labor;recreation
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:14:16:81],[01:14:19:60],What other responsibilities did you have in the home?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:14:20:60],[01:14:56:00],"Well, my first responsibilities were, along with my younger brother, we had to cut the weeds in the garden plot and red roots. There would be a big galvanized washing tub full of red roots, and my younger brother and I were assigned to clean them and cut the roots off. It was a very tedious job that we hated, but we had to do it. I've always liked the red roots. We used them before we had other vegetables. Was that what people call chelite?",family;agriculture;art
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:14:56:42],[01:15:01:50],Yes. I still like them. And did your mom make the chelite?,
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:15:02:10],[01:15:14:60],"Yes, she would cook them with onions and tomatoes if we had them. So then you had to take care of the garden, and did you help your mom with cooking?",health;agriculture
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:15:15:77],[01:15:42:92],"Well, at first I would just help with the florence, shelling green peas, cleaning, trimming green beans, things like that. And the chelites never failed. There was always an ample supply of them. But when my mother got sick, that's when I really had to take over cooking and everything. Well, tell me about your mother getting sick. What happened?",italy;food and drink;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:15:45:12],[01:16:04:88],"Well, the first time I had to take the cooking over, I was 14 years old when Joseph was born. That's the first time I had to take over everything when she went to the hospital. And what year was that that Joseph was born? 1944, July. That's right. And then... What was wrong with her?",health
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:16:06:61],[01:16:57:00],"Well, at that time it was just having the baby, but then when Alex was born her... After Alex was born, her appendix, I think she was having appendicitis attacks, but when the doctors did her blood tests, her blood tests were normal, so they would send her home with a bottle of megalomagneshia at... Wrong thing to do, but she survived. And it was in 1947, just about six weeks after she had marched, that her appendix ruptured. So then she was in the hospital for about three weeks and had pneumonia on top of the ruptured appendix. So then I had the baby to take her off and the whole family, and then my mother when she came home. Did you ever get sick, Rita?",health;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:16:57:46],[01:17:46:42],"Did you ever have a serious illness when you were... Yes, that's what stopped my education. I had been in the fifth grade in Idaho Falls for about four months, and then we went to California and I went to the sixth grade for two weeks. And I was supposed to have gone to the seventh grade because our education in Idaho is higher than California, but I got sick. I started having severe headaches and chills, high fevers, and it turned out to be rheumatic fever, so that was the end of my education. Were you... At the time when you were growing up, did your parents take you to get your immunization shots? They gave them in school. How long were you sick with the rheumatic fever?",education;idaho;health
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:17:50:14],[01:19:43:26],"No, it was... It was something spring. We had been living in Vakersfield and the days were hot, hot, and the nights were cold. That's when I got sick. I thought it was just a case of the flu, very sore throat, probably strep throat, but we didn't used to go to the doctor's for any stomach aches or sore throats. When we stopped on the way home, there was a hill covered with California puppies in bloom. It was all orange, beautiful, and we took a walk up the hill and that, after a while, I started getting kind of blisters on the fronts of my legs. And then when we got to Idaho and started bit thinning, I had always been able to work and keep up with my brothers. Never complained, but this time I was hurting so bad that I just couldn't, especially at night. My sister, who slept with me one time, was taunting me in the daytime after we got out of it, saying, cry baby, cry baby, you were crying. I had always been on the shabby side and him always getting skinnier day by day. So my parents finally took me to the doctor and diagnosed with rheumatic fever. Tell me more about your brothers and sisters. What would be a typical day in the Perez home with your brothers and sisters?",health;idaho;family
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:19:44:10],[01:19:45:56],Did they get along with each other?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:19:50:27],[01:20:50:47],"Since you told me that your father was very strict and he didn't let you go out of the lot where you lived, so therefore you couldn't have very many friends. We had our friends at school, but I think we got along better than most children. There were some, oh, once in a while. Like one time, Cecil was very careful with his clothing, like to keep him nice and he'd gotten a new coat for school. And here, Danny, who was in charge of taking care of the kindling, would start the fire in the cold stove and the heater, had used Cecil's new coat to go rummishing at the dumpster, tomato crates, and came home. So Cecil was very unhappy with Danny. How did your parents discipline you?",family;education;clothing;health;technology
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:20:51:43],[01:20:56:57],Was there a difference between the way they disciplined your brothers and the way they disciplined the sisters?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:20:57:39],[01:21:50:92],"Oh, yes. We all knew, so it was very seldom that anybody got disciplined. But if the boys broke rules, quite bad. Remember one time, my parents were napping after the beat harvesting, I mean, beat thinning season. My parents were making up for lost sleep. So there were my brothers in the neighbor's strawberry patch. I think it was a Sunday afternoon. The neighbors must have been at church, so my brothers were over there and I was going to join them and they wouldn't let me. So I went and tattled. When they were getting whipped, I repented. I wished I hadn't tattled on them. But it was very seldom. Girls just never got the belt. We got lectured. So when you were a teenager, did you go out and have fun?",religion;recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:21:51:31],[01:21:58:02],No. I was busy helping with the kids at home. What about your older brothers?,
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:21:59:27],[01:22:37:47],"Your older brother? When there was work, they were usually too tired after putting in 16, 18 hours work to care to go anywhere. They did. My second oldest brother at one time even played hooky from work. He went up with his friend and we thought he was going to get scalped. He came home with a bag of fresh fish. They had gone fishing. My father was so happy to get the fresh fish for gaming. So that was good. So how about your younger sisters?",family;health;recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:22:38:30],[01:22:42:27],"When they were teenagers, did they go out?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:22:43:18],[01:23:09:72],"No. They did go out only to ball games with my brothers. But that was all. Unless my brothers went with them, there was no going out. So then they had to be shaft prone by your older brothers? Well, and they were just going out to have fun, observe, but not what you would call dating. I see. So they went to the ball games. What kind of ball games were there?",recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:23:10:28],[01:23:13:89],"Baseball, football. Did your brothers play in those games?",
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:23:14:54],[01:23:47:26],"One of my brothers, Danny, started. But then when he had to take time off for harvest and again all summer long where they were practicing daily, this what you call, he was not allowed to be in the team if he couldn't be there all the time. If he didn't make it to the practice? He was disqualified. Tell me about your home. How many rooms were there in your home, in your house?",agriculture
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:23:47:93],[01:24:54:39],"Well, the original was ten by sixteen. And then my father added some before I was born, far back. I can remember that's where we were, quarantine when we had the chicken pox and missiles in the winter of 36, 37. It was made of railroad ties, kind of like a log house with wood on the top and then dirt for insulation. Then in 39 he added another addition to the whole front of the place that was about 12 by 24. So that was the size of the house. Very crowded, but we managed. Well, did you have other relatives living with you, or did you... No, no, one of my father's brothers came and lived with us for a while. There was always room for one more. And did he come to work in the potato harvest or thinning beads or...? No, no, it was when we were older and he was sick when he came. I see. How... what year was that, do you remember?",family;food and drink;railroads and transportation;agriculture
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:24:56:31],[01:25:15:68],"It must have been around 1953, 1954. And did you celebrate as you were growing up? Did you celebrate any... any... vocation like Quincea Neras or...?",labor

Rita Padilla Perez,[01:25:31:88],[01:25:45:76],"Then if we had the means we'd buy some little thing for my mother. Well, how long did you live with your parents, Rita?",family
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:25:46:73],[01:26:04:03],"Until I went to Salt Lake in 1965. I see. Did you have someone aside from the home that you respected very much, aside from your parents?",food and drink;recreation
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:26:05:73],[01:27:55:02],"I like my father's sister. She lived in California very much and her eldest daughter, Mary. I think the world of her, she was more like a sister or almost a second mother. Always very kind and understanding to us. And principal that we had at Riverside School in Idaho Falls, Mr. Bush. The principal at your school? Yes. And tell me why you respected him so much? Well, one winter a boy who was head and shoulders taller than my brother had been picking on him all through the winter. Finally in the spring something snapped. My brother had had all he could take and he grabbed his boy and just banged his head against the bark of a tree until it was bleeding and the boy was bowering. Mr. Bush was up there looking out, watching from the second floor window and he didn't do anything to stop my brother. Well, the bell rang. It was during lunchtime recess and that saved the boy. He went home crying. My brother went into the classroom. So here comes the boy's mother in a fur coat. That means they must have had money. I was demanding that my brother be expelled from school. Mr. Bush told her that she needed to teach her son to respect others. My brother had put up with his lack of respect all winter long, so my brother had finally given him his due.

Rosa Rodriguez,[01:28:59:31],[01:29:56:80],"Well, there was that one, which means a drop of blood is worth more than a ton of flesh, meaning that those that once on race are more likely to be helpful and understanding and compassionate. But then there was also another one, quote, no I Kuna mas mala, que la del mismo palo, meaning there's no nail worse than the one from the same wood. Meaning that those of our own are more likely to hurt us the worst, whether of our own race or our own family.

Rita Padilla Perez,[01:29:58:06],[01:30:59:18],"I think it is important, but I think it's dying out with this generation. You're talking about the generation of your nieces and nephews. Yes, like my brothers and sisters children are not at all interested in Mexican celebrations, activities. They all like tortillas and tamales, but some of them. But as far as festivities, they don't care for them. Well, Rita, you were never married. Right. Okay, so you don't have children of your own. What was the reason that you never married? I was going to be married. I see. I was in a country for 13 months. But I got homesick. And I came home.

Rosa Rodriguez,[01:31:00:23],[01:31:52:60],"I didn't really attend, but we were living at the labor camp in Drinks. It was the 16th of September, very unusual that work was still going on. So there we were. So the Mexican families got together and they made a barbecue at the cheap and things. Best barbecue I ever had. They had dance and music. Well, did the own workers, they played, like for example, you say they had dances. Did they play instruments? Yes, they had their guitars mainly and accordions, violins, horns. Beautiful sounds.

Rita Padilla Perez,[01:33:34:52],[01:34:46:72],"I think it was both a combination. We had worked for a man that was a crop -renting farm, and when he hurt his back and could not do the work anymore, the owner asked him about somebody to work her place, so he said, yes, my in -laws' neighbors are very good workers and respect the ground. They'd be ideal. They have worked on the place, and she answered with, I happen to know who they are. Not only are they Mexicans, they're also Catholics. So that was about, it was a beautiful place. It looked like something out of a picture book. This is Rosa Rodriguez in Idaho Falls. I'm interviewing Rita Perez. This is tape number two. Rita, can you tell me a little bit about your feelings on the restrictions to immigration from Mexico?",agriculture;idaho;migration;mexico
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:34:49:38],[01:35:50:69],"Maybe it's very simple. There would be no need for restrictions if the money exchange was more reasonable. Right now, I believe it's about 2 ,500 pesos to a dollar. They can come here and spend a season and make enough to buy a house or a car, which they cannot do in Mexico. Besides, all of the produce in Mexico is being sold to the United States for dollar value. People working for pesos can no way pay dollar values for produce over there, so they have to come to United States in order to get dollars to pay dollar value for their needs to survive. Rita, can you tell me a little bit more about when your father came to work in the railroad, when he traveled from Mexico to California and on?",mexico;family;railroads and transportation
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:35:53:85],[01:36:04:93],"Well, what I heard was that he went as far east working with the railroad and then back to Nevada the first time he was here. What year was that, Rita?",railroads and transportation
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:36:06:02],[01:36:33:19],"I'm not sure, but it was sometime before the 20s. Anyway, when the work was, he had sent his paycheck home, and then they were told, that's it, boys. So here he was without money or provisions. And where was he?",labor
Rita Padilla Perez,[01:36:36:77],[01:39:16:72],"So he started walking south, tired, hungry, thirsty. He came to where there was a store in the desert, there was a pile of wood that needed to be chopped. So he approached, trying to sign language that he would chop the wood in exchange for food. The proprietors sicked the dogs on him. He dragged on until the dogs were called off and set to rest, wondering if he would die of starvation in this land, that he had once thought so rich the streets were paved with marble and the buildings made of gold. Eventually, a group of Mexicans came by and shared their provisions with him, invited him to join them on the trek south, which he did. He found work and stayed just long enough to earn money to return to his homeland, disillusioned and determined never to return to this land, where dogs were well -fed. But human beings could starve or be torn to pieces by dogs. He had seen this at work, where the minority workers were assigned dangerous work without any provisions made for their safety or survival. But he came home, and because our revolution was raging on in Mexico, his father told him that he was bad enough man -killing men. But when brothers were killing brothers over political dissent, he would not have his son take part in the phrase. The only way to prevent this was not to be there, so he ordered him back to the United States. Even offering financial assistance if necessary. So it was that my father returned to the United States again, working on the railroad, which brought him to Idaho for the first time in 1919. He returned again in 1921 and again in 1923. Rita, how much would your father get paid on a normal working day? I don't know if you've already answered me that question, but working in the railroad... It wasn't very much, but I know when I started working and was getting about 90 cents an hour, and when my pay was raised to a dollar, he said he had to work for a dollar a day and not just eight hours, but 12, 16 hours a day for a dollar. When he worked in the railroad?",recreation;conflict;mexico;family;railroads and transportation;idaho
Rosa Rodriguez,[01:39:21:26],[01:43:12:88],"In 1924, he returned to Mexico and married my mother, Rosa Padilla, on June 5, 1924. Promising her not to return to the United States. He had started a business, but when he voted openly for a man or party that the townspeople did not approve of, his business was by -cotted and he was persecuted. So he returned to the United States in July 1924 with his bride. Coming first to Arizona, where they visited his sister, that it was too much. Neither of them could endure it. They went to San Francisco, where my father's brother was living and working. My father found work in the sugar factory, but had to work the night shift all the time, leaving his 16 -year -old bride alone and lonely. Her health deteriorated in the damp climate and low altitude of this area, to the point where a doctor told my father that she needed to be returned to the country, that she was accustomed to if she was to survive. They were saving for this trip when my father was laid off from work. There was only money for one train fare to Idaho. So then, they weren't going to go back to Mexico. They were going to come to Idaho. They were going to come to Idaho. So my father proposed putting my mother on the train and bombing rights on the train himself. My mother was petrified at the thought of traveling by herself without knowing the language. So when my father left the apartment to take care of the final business, she went to work. She cut off her knee -length hair, pulled the cap down over her ears, put on my father's clothing and overalls. She was ready to travel with him as his brother. When he came and saw her here, he was accustomed to tears. But she gave him the alternative. Either she would accompany him or he could take her back to her parents' home. So he had no choice but to yell to her demand. They walked without skirts of San Francisco where they, quote, boarded a train in the dark, meaning they didn't pay. They had no problems until they were on a bridge over the South Lakes in Utah. It was dusk when a conductor cut them. He knew my mother was not this man's brother. He told my father to tell it to the authorities in Salt Lake City. It's a good thing the conductor had to go tend to his work and gave them a chance to escape and hide under the bridge until dark. Then, in the dark of night, when there was no sign of life around, they walked at night. They slept in hiding during the day. And they walked to Ogden. They were afraid to try bombing. They were on the train again for fear of being cut that the conductor might have alerted the authorities. But they got to Ogden where they again, quote, boarded a train in the dark.
