Ofilia Ramos,[00:14:32:06],00;14;55;13,"Well, probably the one at Parker, because I don't know. She stands in my mind because she gave me a little, a little golden book.

And then another time at the same school at, Emerson, I'm pretty sure it's on Third Street.",education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:15:32:16],00;16;01;02,"Emerson. And, there was this little girl and I, and there was a little boy, you know, all the same age. And I said something and she giggled.

Ofilia Ramos,[00:16:01:04],00;16;20;02,"I didn't know what and she didn't take time. The only thing the teacher told me was, a little girl shouldn't say that. Well, that's great, but I. I don't know what I said wrong because.",education
Rosa Rodriguez,[00:16:20:04],00;16;30;17,"How do you think education opportunities for Mexican-Americans in Idaho, changed in your lifetime?",education;idaho
Ofilia Ramos,[00:16:30:20],00;17;01;11,"Well, when I first graduated in 1961 from Idaho Falls High. I don't think it probably was. Overall, I don't think there was a lot of government grants. And the only way you could go if you go to college, I wanted to go to college, but the only way you could go was either your parents paid for you, of course they needed to have money or you got scholarships.",idaho
Ofilia Ramos,[00:17:01:13],00;17;36;05,"And and the only, the only thing with scholarships is that you have to be, I mean, real smart, or at least your grades had to reflect your real smart. And mine weren't that that great. But I still wanted to go to school. And then later on, 15, maybe later on. It did get better. And I think it is better because I myself went to school under a grant and I, I really appreciate that.",education

Ofilia Ramos,[00:17:55:10],00;18;29;15,"Oh, I. By the report, I see and I hear they're not doing too well yet. It's. I think they're odd. The the figures have improved, I think more kids, more Hispanic kids. Mexican-Americans are staying in school because their parents are educated. And the ones that are are educated, they are staying in school. And I think it's improved. But you're you still have the problem with, with the laborers, with the migrant workers.",education;migration

Ofilia Ramos,[00:19:36:21],00;20;08;10,"Well, they thought that was pretty neat. They really. My both my father and mother, wanted us, the children, to be educated because they knew that without education, without knowing the language. Well, you know, it just doesn't hold your future doesn't look too good. And so they really the they really push for the education. My father learned to read and write by himself.",family;education
Ofilia Ramos,[00:20:08:12],00;20;23;20,"Like a lot of people, probably back in the Old West, I call it, they learned by themselves. And my mom also could read a little bit. She didn't know how to write, but she didn't know how to read a little bit.",
