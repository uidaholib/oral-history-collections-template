And the answer is, you know, we do because we are the federal government. And if we were all together, I would ask, people to raise your hand if you've been to a national park, a national monument, a forest, a you've been down a wild and scenic river, you visited a historic site, you've gone to Washington, DC, and and I can pretty quickly get every single person in the room to raise their hand.",

So we start with the United States forest Service. The United States Forest system is administered by the United States Forest Service.
