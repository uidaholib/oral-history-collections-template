This is not the way I would prefer to talk about women's suffrage, but I guess I'm glad to be talking about it in any venue. So Idaho's history with women's suffrage really has two components. It has an early, wide component that involved, you know, amendment Idaho, and then it has a ratification of the 19th amendment that we're celebrating the centennial of the, this year.",
