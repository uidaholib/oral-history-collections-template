Martha Tórrez,[00:00:05:16],[00:00:07:15],"Okay, Mr. Vásquez,",
Abel Vásquez,[00:00:07:18],[00:00:09:21],Okay.,
Martha Tórrez,[00:00:09:23],[00:00:19:16],Okay. I'd like to begin by just asking you how it is that you and your family came to the state of Idaho.,family;idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:00:19:18],[00:00:40:23],"Well, when we came to Idaho, it was much. I didn't have a choice. It was something I had to do. I was raised by my grandparents, and at the time we came to Idaho, I was only eight years old, so needless to say, I had to come to the state with my folks to work in the fields.",idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:00:40:26],[00:00:43:10],So that is how I came to be in Idaho?,idaho
Martha Tórrez,[00:00:43:12],[00:00:45:02],Now you were raised by your grandparents?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:00:45:02],[00:01:21:12],"I was raised by my grandparents due to the fact that my mother died when I was very young. It was a strange story. I guess it's because when my mother and father separated, I was six months old, my mother took my older brother and raised him until she passed away in 1940.",family
Abel Vásquez,[00:01:21:14],[00:01:44:21],"But my grandmother took my older sister, Helen, and myself when we were babies, and as little kids, she raised us. So I was raised by my grandmother from early childhood.",family
Martha Tórrez,[00:01:44:23],[00:01:58:14],"And so, when you were living with your grandparents, where were you living? And if you could explain to me a little bit about how it was that you came to be in Idaho.",idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:01:58:17],[00:02:31:03],"How I came to be in Idaho was, we were living in Grand Junction, Colorado, and we were bean field workers. That's all we knew at the time. So we used to follow the field work. How we came to Idaho: my grandmother had a sister who lived in Salt Lake City, and we went from Grand Junction, Colorado, to Salt Lake City to visit my grandmother's sister.",idaho;family;food and drink;recreation
Abel Vásquez,[00:02:31:05],[00:02:59:21],"And we stayed there maybe six months or a year, I can't really recall how long. And that was in 1937 or '38, I think the fall of 1938. In the fall of 1938, my grandfather and some other people decided to come to Idaho because there was field work to do, sugar beets.",family;idaho
Martha Tórrez,[00:02:59:23],[00:03:01:09],"So the opportunity, or...",
Abel Vásquez,[00:03:01:09],[00:03:21:20],"Job opportunity arose. And so we came to Preston Idaho, me my grandmother, my sister and my grandfather. We went to Preston Idaho in the fall of 1938.",idaho;family
Martha Tórrez,[00:03:21:23],[00:03:28:08],"Did you do any other kind of farm work? Other than beets, did you work in other types of agriculture throughout the years??",agriculture
Abel Vásquez,[00:03:32:07],[00:03:53:29],"Yeah, I remember, when we were little and stayed in Utah, we used to pull onions. I remember topping onions, somewhere close to Salt Lake. But when we came to Idaho, the season was to top beets. It was the fall of the year.",food and drink;recreation;idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:03:53:29],[00:04:25:14],"And so we used to meet and camp. We used a knife with a little hook on the end, like a machete, and that's what we did in 1938. We stayed there all winter of 1938. In the spring of '39, we followed the work.",recreation
Abel Vásquez,[00:04:25:16],[00:04:45:21],"So we came to Idaho. Why did we come to Marsing? I'm not really clear whether we knew somebody there or we just happened to say, 'Let’s go to the other part of Idaho, go to Marsing.' But all I know is that we landed in Marsing in 1939. You know, we were here before, they were here.",idaho;marsing
Abel Vásquez,[00:04:45:21],[00:04:47:00],They were here.,
Martha Tórrez,[00:04:47:03],[00:04:54:27],"When you traveled to Idaho, did you come by your own transportation that year? And did you come out with other families, or was it just your family?",idaho;family
Abel Vásquez,[00:04:54:27],[00:05:06:13],"It was just my grandparents and us. We didn't know anybody. We were just by ourselves. And when we came to Marsing, I think we were by ourselves also.",marsing
Martha Tórrez,[00:05:06:16],[00:05:07:11],So you drove?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:05:07:17],[00:05:33:14],"We drove here. We had, and I think it was an old pickup truck, if I'm not mistaken. But we landed in Marsing, and the ideal situation in those days was to find a farmer who had year-round work, where you could start in the spring, thin the beets, clean them, and then find some work in between. And then in the fall, you topped the beets. And so that's what we did.",marsing
Martha Tórrez,[00:05:40:12],[00:05:44:16],What are your very first memories of Idaho when you first got here? What did you think of it?,idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:05:44:18],[00:06:08:19],"Cold, especially in eastern Idaho. It was very, very cold. And, needless to say, working in the fields as a kid, we'd go out to the beet fields, and it was so cold the leaves, the tops from the beets, would break off. They were frozen.",health;idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:06:08:23],[00:06:10:03],It was cold.,health
Martha Tórrez,[00:06:10:06],[00:06:12:15],So do you have any idea where you're from originally?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:06:12:18],[00:06:19:23],"No, no, but I like it here. Yeah, it was very cold here.",health
Martha Tórrez,[00:06:19:25],[00:06:22:23],I know you said the very first place you came to was Preston.,idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:06:22:23],[00:06:23:13],,
Martha Tórrez,[00:06:23:16],[00:06:26:18],Can you describe where you lived?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:06:26:20],[00:06:53:03],"Well, it wasn't long ago, but I'm sure it was just a very small shack, probably just a one-room house that I can remember. We probably had to go to the farmer's house to get water.",
Abel Vásquez,[00:06:53:03],[00:07:06:18],"We didn't have any bathroom facilities, you know, you had an outhouse. Okay, so that's what I recall mostly when I first came to Idaho: that it was cold.",idaho;health
Martha Tórrez,[00:07:06:21],[00:07:12:00],"Now, once you got here, did you travel to other cities in Idaho or to other states?",idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:07:12:01],[00:07:38:05],"Once we came to Idaho, we went to Marsing. We stayed in Marsing and worked in Marsing. But while we were in Marsing, we used to go to other areas, like the McCall-Donnelly area to pick peas. We used to go to Emmett to work in the pea fields.",idaho;marsing
Abel Vásquez,[00:07:38:05],[00:07:56:12],"And also, we used to grow carrots there, you could tie carrots in the water in the Emmett area. And I also lived temporarily, maybe two or three months, in a labor camp in Oregon.",idaho;labor;recreation
Martha Tórrez,[00:07:56:14],[00:08:01:22],And what was that like?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:08:01:24],[00:08:23:29],"As a kid, if you have your parents, or your grandparents, you don't put too much emphasis on things like we do now. You don't worry about the economics of it. You just work, go to school, and you've got a place to eat and sleep, and you're happy.",education
Abel Vásquez,[00:08:24:06],[00:08:24:24],Okay.,
Martha Tórrez,[00:08:24:26],[00:08:26:12],So it was positive for you?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:08:26:15],[00:08:45:20],"Oh, yes, very positive. I remember at that particular time, when we were living in that labor camp, my older brother Rudy got really sick with a constant virus, and he just about died there. But, needless to say, he didn't.",labor;recreation;family;health
Martha Tórrez,[00:08:45:27],[00:08:48:07],But so he was hospitalized?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:08:48:10],[00:08:57:14],"No, I don't think he was. I think he was just taken care of right there in the camp. He made it through.",health;recreation
Martha Tórrez,[00:08:57:16],[00:09:09:05],Were there any other Mexican American families living in Idaho when you first arrived? Do you remember anything about the Bracero program or undocumented workers?,mexico;idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:09:09:12],[00:09:35:10],"I remember when they first started to come. As far as other Hispanics being here when we first arrived, I can't recall ever seeing any. I do know that shortly after we came, other Hispanics came to live where we lived in Marsing.",marsing
Abel Vásquez,[00:09:35:12],[00:09:50:28],"And I do remember the Braceros, when they used to come here to work in the fields. One of the things that really used to amaze me about those poor people was that they'd work out in the fields like we used to in the wintertime, topping beets, like I was telling you about earlier.",
Abel Vásquez,[00:09:51:01],[00:09:59:21],"And they'd wear whatever they had, and, mind you, it was a hard life for them at the time.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:09:59:26],[00:10:07:04],"What else do you remember from that era about these people who were coming in, like the Braceros?",
Abel Vásquez,[00:10:07:08],[00:10:36:22],"The workers, when they first came here, would put up with almost anything to make money to send back to their families in Mexico. They would live in little houses bunched together, shacks all put together.",mexico
Abel Vásquez,[00:10:36:25],[00:11:07:14],"I do remember when we were living in Marsing in 1940–41, my grandmother used to take in boarders and cook for them. We used to have a little shack in the back, but we lived in a tent, and these people would come to work in the fields. My grandmother made extra money by giving them room and board, and she had to cook for them.",marsing;family
Abel Vásquez,[00:11:07:14],[00:11:32:24],"Sometimes there were maybe 12 to 15 people she would board, and she charged them about a dollar to a dollar and a half a day for room and board. She was doing all the cooking for those people on an old wood stove, I'm sure you've seen them. That's how she cooked for all those people.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:11:32:26],[00:11:41:18],You mentioned these people put up with whatever they had to in order to keep working. Do you remember any kind of differential treatment they had to endure?,health
Abel Vásquez,[00:11:49:05],[00:12:09:17],"Well, I can't really say. I don't know if they were treated any differently. At my age, I thought that was just the way it was supposed to be, I thought it was normal. So it's really difficult for me to say they weren't treated fairly, because I didn't know any better.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:12:09:18],[00:12:11:11],Do you recall any specific situation?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:12:11:17],[00:12:31:26],"No, I don't recall a farmer ever mistreating them or discriminating against them. I cannot recall that. I know they worked hard.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:12:31:28],[00:12:36:10],"So it sounds like, compared to white workers, they did the same work.",
Abel Vásquez,[00:12:36:12],[00:12:54:25],"Oh, no, neither did we, really. If we didn't have proper clothing for the conditions, that was our problem. Nobody supplied us with anything.",clothing
Martha Tórrez,[00:12:54:27],[00:13:02:10],Was that difficult? Do you remember them having to go out and work without proper clothing?,clothing
Abel Vásquez,[00:13:02:10],[00:13:29:21],"Again, sometimes we think ignorance is bliss. When you don't know there's something better, you do the best you can with what you have. I'm sure my grandmother and grandfather worried whether we were adequately dressed to do the job, but we didn't know any better.",family
Martha Tórrez,[00:13:29:23],[00:13:46:08],"And you weren't around any other way of living, so that was normal for you: as long as you had a place to be warm and something to eat.",
Abel Vásquez,[00:13:46:10],[00:14:00:21],"So anyway, that's what I remember about growing up as a little Mexican boy here in Marsing.",mexico;marsing
Martha Tórrez,[00:14:00:24],[00:14:08:00],"When you worked in the fields, do you remember anything about wages, what you were paid?",
Abel Vásquez,[00:14:08:02],[00:14:41:19],"Well, we always worked piecework, we never got paid by the hour. My grandfather always taught us, 'You're going to get paid for what you do, the more you do, the more you make.' We never worked by the hour. All piecework. I remember topping beets for six or seven dollars an acre.",family
Abel Vásquez,[00:14:41:22],[00:15:14:19],"I remember popping beets by the ton, I can't recall how much per ton, but we used to haul the tops by hand onto a truck. Sometimes the fields were so muddy we had to hitch a team of horses to the truck to pull it out because the weather was so bad. Those little things stick in my mind because they don't happen anymore.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:15:14:26],[00:15:17:15],So work was basically just a lot harder than it is today?,
Abel Vásquez,[00:15:17:17],[00:15:19:03],"Oh yes, right.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:15:19:10],[00:15:23:07],"I mean, you were only like ten or twelve years old.",
Abel Vásquez,[00:15:23:07],[00:15:48:27],"And I have a grandson who's having a birthday today, he's nine years old. I sit down sometimes, didn't tell him, but I think: at eight years old, I was outside in cold weather, working alongside my grandpa topping beets. And today, we don't even think about it.",health
Abel Vásquez,[00:15:48:29],[00:15:52:05],Yeah,
Martha Tórrez,[00:15:52:08],[00:15:57:09],"Right. Now on the subject of education, you did attend school in Marsing. Describe your earliest memory of school.",education;marsing
Abel Vásquez,[00:16:19:08],[00:16:46:29],"I started school in Grand Junction, Colorado, in first and second grade. We lived in a place called La Colonia, next to a sugar beet factory, the railroad tracks, and the river, a typical place where they put all the Hispanics.",education;labor;railroads and transportation
Abel Vásquez,[00:16:47:01],[00:17:24:10],"I think even today we sometimes segregate ourselves, not because Anglo people separate us, but because we do it ourselves. Anyway, I remember walking to school barefoot, we didn't have money sometimes. I started school in Grand Junction up to second grade, and I started third grade in Marsing.",recreation;education;marsing
Martha Tórrez,[00:17:24:13],[00:17:30:25],Was there a difference? Did the school system feel different from Colorado to Idaho?,education;idaho
Abel Vásquez,[00:17:30:27],[00:17:53:04],"No, I don't think it was that different. At that time, school was about learning to read, write, and do arithmetic, the 'three R's.' That was most important. We didn't have all the extras we have today, but I didn't notice a real difference. In Colorado or Idaho, you learned to read, write, and do arithmetic.",education;idaho
Martha Tórrez,[00:18:09:06],[00:18:32:12],"Right, school must have been nice for you. I know from my own experience that sometimes where I was raised, it was so cold I didn't have enough to keep me warm. You were one of many children, so going to school, a warm room, new pencils, Crayolas, a well-groomed teacher with polish and lipstick, was a whole new world you didn't have at home.",education;health
Abel Vásquez,[00:18:54:10],[00:18:55:20],"Oh yes, right.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:18:55:23],[00:19:07:09],"Because of your living conditions, school was like an escape, something nice and orderly.",education
Abel Vásquez,[00:19:07:13],[00:19:08:06],Well-groomed.,
Martha Tórrez,[00:19:08:06],[00:19:26:07],"Teachers like that, our mothers weren't glamorous; they were busy raising children, and our fathers were out in the fields. So school was a completely different world.",education
Abel Vásquez,[00:19:26:13],[00:19:28:10],It's a completely different world.,
Martha Tórrez,[00:19:28:13],[00:19:34:01],Do you recall any other Hispanic children in your class when you came in third grade?,education
Abel Vásquez,[00:19:34:04],[00:19:45:20],"I was the only one, well, me and my sister were the only ones in Marsing until 1940. We were the only Hispanics.",family;marsing
Martha Tórrez,[00:19:45:20],[00:19:46:28],Probably one of the very first.,
Abel Vásquez,[00:19:46:28],[00:19:50:13],"First, right.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:19:50:15],[00:19:51:20],First year in this area.,
Abel Vásquez,[00:19:51:21],[00:20:08:24],"Right, the first Hispanics I can remember. Then in 1940, some other people came from Grand Junction, and I remember them coming to live in Marsing. So it was just me and my sister who were the first Hispanics.",marsing;family
Martha Tórrez,[00:20:08:27],[00:20:12:18],Came here to set up to ah...,
Abel Vásquez,[00:20:12:21],[00:20:17:20],"Maravilla, yeah they were there.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:20:17:23],[00:20:21:01],How do you recall being in school as far as grades?,education
Abel Vásquez,[00:20:21:03],[00:20:56:07],"I was just an average student. My parents didn't put much emphasis on education, they figured they'd rather have a good worker than a good scholar. But we did fairly well. I never flunked a grade. The ironic thing is, we used to start school late, like in November, and only go about six months a year because we had to quit early to work in the fields and start late because harvest was still going.",education;labor;agriculture
Abel Vásquez,[00:20:56:07],[00:21:25:04],"So my teachers took extra time with me, helping me catch up. And the other kids, the Anglo kids, also helped me. All the teachers were really nice to me and my sister, and the students were very helpful.",family
Martha Tórrez,[00:22:14:12],[00:22:21:20],"You started in November, it sounded like it was just you. Was that the norm for migrant families?",migration
Abel Vásquez,[00:22:21:20],[00:22:44:28],"School was always September to whenever, but we had to quit and start late because September and October had the best working weather. When it got cold, we went to school all winter. Then in spring, when it warmed up, our parents pulled us out to work. That's why I never flunked, I must have had good teachers who worked hard to help me catch up.",education;health
Martha Tórrez,[00:23:06:16],[00:23:25:17],"He was a bright boy, from what I can see. Even when I met him before we got married, I saw so much potential. He's a born mathematician. After we married, he told me that as a little boy, the older men, who couldn't read or write, would single him out to figure out their acreage and pay. He had to be a smart kid to do that.",
Martha Tórrez,[00:23:48:11],[00:23:51:27],"So your experience was shaped by the harvest, you had to leave school early.",agriculture;education
Abel Vásquez,[00:23:51:29],[00:23:52:13],You know.,
Martha Tórrez,[00:23:52:15],[00:24:02:06],"It doesn't sound like you had to move to new cities or states often, so you didn't change schools much.",
Abel Vásquez,[00:24:02:06],[00:24:04:21],I remember the only time I changed schools was when we came to Nampa. I started seventh grade there in 1943.,nampa;education
Martha Tórrez,[00:24:20:05],[00:24:27:01],What do you remember about being a Mexican-American student in school?,education

Abel Vásquez,[00:24:56:05],[00:25:22:15],"Actually, we spoke more English at home because my grandmother was fluent in English. My step-grandfather didn't understand English, so we used Spanish for his benefit. But no, I don't recall it being a problem.",family
Martha Tórrez,[00:25:22:19],[00:25:40:15],It was more English-speaking than Spanish. It wasn't until we got married that we spoke more Spanish. I could see he was comfortable in both languages.,
Abel Vásquez,[00:25:40:17],[00:26:09:15],"By 1943, more Hispanics were here. In fact, a family from Grand Junction came to Marsing around 1940 or '41, my grandmother knew them. They're still here, dear friends. They later moved to Nampa.",family;marsing;nampa

Abel Vásquez,[00:26:39:27],[00:27:06:25],"Yes, one. In third grade, I think I had a crush on her. Mrs. Gilmore, my teacher in Marsing. She went the extra mile to help me. She knew I needed more help than the other kids.",education;marsing
Abel Vásquez,[00:27:06:25],[00:27:21:23],She would take me by the hand and help me. That's what teaching was to me. I'm sure she knew I'd missed school and needed to catch up.,education

Abel Vásquez,[00:30:04:11],[00:30:27:12],"I think I was trying to relive my childhood through my kids. I really wanted to play basketball, but I didn't want to burden my folks, they could barely make ends meet. So I said I didn't want to play anymore. I never participated in sports because you had to stay after school to practice, and that was when we worked in the fields.",recreation;education
Abel Vásquez,[00:30:57:04],[00:31:21:27],"Being a field worker, you had to work when crops were ready, the crops didn't wait for you. As the older male in the family, I was next in line to help support us. I liked school, but by 14, it became a hassle.

Martha Tórrez,[00:32:26:20],[00:32:31:19],You felt out of place.,
Abel Vásquez,[00:32:34:28],[00:32:58:19],"I felt out of place, not because I thought I wasn't adequate, but because I didn't have nice jeans, shoes, or shirts like the other kids. I knew something was wrong, but the kids didn't make me feel that way. I was my own worst critic. At 14, in ninth grade, I quit school.",clothing;education
Martha Tórrez,[00:33:28:14],[00:33:48:02],"Did you feel resentment? Did you blame anyone for not fitting in, because of peer pressure and not having what others had?",
Abel Vásquez,[00:33:48:04],[00:34:19:18],I didn't have resentment. I don't think the kids cared how I looked. I was my own worst critic. Some of those kids are still friends of mine today.,
