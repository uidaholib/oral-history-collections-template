## About the Digital Collection

The Latah County Oral HIstory Collections consists of audio interview recordings and transcriptions for over 300 interviews conducted during the mid-1970s. This collection is a digital representation of the [Latah County Oral History Collection (MG 415)](http://nwda.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv27761/), which is held by the University of Idaho Library's Special Collections & Archives.

In order to provide enhanced access to this collection, the Digital Initiatives Department employed an open-source plug-in called the [Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS)](http://www.oralhistoryonline.org/), which was created at the University of Kentucky. OHMS provides additional layers of access by connecting the audio and transcript files of a digitized oral history on a single page, and by providing real-time searching of keywords in transcripts and indexes there as well. OHMS synchronizes transcribed text with timestamps in the audio and provides a viewer that connects search results of a transcript to the corresponding moment in the audio file.

In the course of preparing this collection, hundreds of cassette tapes were converted to digital audio files, and the typescript transcripts for over 300 interviews were scanned and made full-text searchable. To do this, staff and student assistants created complex XML files that included full-text transcripts for many of the interviews, as well as original timestamps and synopses for most interviews, which were originally provided by the transcriber. Each interview was then described using the [Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) for keywords and subjects, as well as tagged locations that were later connected to Google Maps via latitude and longitude coordinates. These subjects and locations are now fully linked and searchable through the website.

## Migration

In December 2023, due to changing repository platforms and new development processes, the original LCOH site was migrated.
This version of the site is a transition that updates the data and web markup, and will be enhanced in the near future with new features to better support this unique oral history content.
