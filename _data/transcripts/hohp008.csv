If, say, that if it was in this, it was in the spring, they would need them to work in the fields and the potato in the beet fields, like for thinning and growing.

And then, first is only, I think 30 miles from Idaho Falls. It's not really a whole lot for schools. And that was where we'd go mostly was styrofoam and wheat.

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:08:09:19],00;08;54;14,"And from there we would go like on the 4th of July. And that's what we're like closest.

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:08:50:27],00;09;48;21,"The you. So they used to rely on them actually, because he went to Mexico. But my mother never did go back. But my, my dad did even in 1926 to.

But my mother never but always, remember somewhere, always that they would always talk about their country.",mexico;family
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:09:25:21],00;10;12;19,"They never did reminisce over and over and over and, and I remember, like I say, when read TV and radio and all that stuff, and those kids never got bored with the stories that they would tell us.

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:09:49:21],00;10;45;10,"They too, they were poor people, but they took care of the cabin for a rich man and they would take in the summer. They would take the cabins up to the mountains, I guess. I don't know where they took their cows, but my mother used to say about how they would climb up in the mountains and they would sit down, I guess some some kind of a high place they could see down in the distance, and I could kind of visualize because they in the distance, they could see the smoke of the trains that would go by far away.",health;environment;family
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:10:22:10],00;11;10;11,"And she would dream of someday getting a moment train and going away somewhere.

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:10:47:14],00;11;35;12,"My daddy's work permit and but we have we did have company. People from Pocatello would visit us out there for the Mexicans that were in Shelley, too. There was at the sugar factory.

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:11:12:19],00;11;44;25,That's where they had to. And there was a lot of Mexicans initially that lived there and worked in the fields and farms and there.,
Angela Luckey,[00:11:21:27],00;11;47;17,Where there are a lot of other families that went to Lincoln with you.,
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:11:24:23],00;12;13;10,"Oh, yes. Well, see, that's a that's trainload. And from there they dispersed and and there's we go over the many different places and like I say probably I don't know, I don't really remember I remember these Mexican families that lived in Chile. Now I can't tell you for sure if they were brought there like from Lincoln, you know, like they might have been brought there.",mexico
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:11:50:13],00;12;40;18,"But Lincoln was where they brought them as a group, and then they might have brought them to Shelley to closer to the farms that were around them, so that I don't remember. I don't remember that, but I remember the Mexicans that lived in and that we used to go visit them, some in the farms around around Lincoln and around there that lived for but not not right there in the sugar factory.",labor
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:12:17:19],00;12;43;08,We lived them in the farms.,

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:12:22:11],00;12;57;21,"No, no, no, they didn't use the house, just that they just housed them. No, I didn't have no land. They might have land at a garden. Maybe we go to. Other than that. No, that made this work there for the farmers.",agriculture
Angela Luckey,[00:12:34:23],00;13;04;04,So it was a land. The houses belonged to the farmer. Yeah. And then they just lived in there. When they were there.,
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:12:41:07],00;13;27;21,"They moved in and just lived there. And they worked for these farmers. And and I don't ever remember any mistreatment or anything. They just worked for the for the farmers. And they had interpreters. I always remember this one lady, Mrs. Pearce, her name was in Pablo. She was in Chile. She was the interpreter for the Mexicans around there.",
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:13:04:24],00;13;51;26,"Just to Mrs. Pearce, my mother talked about her man who had already I could be. I must have been 6 or 7 that I met this lady, Mrs. Pearce, and my mother. This was Mrs. Pearce, one that was the interpreter for the Mexican woman, and she spoke very well. So I guess that's why they. And she wouldn't wear the war end.",family;mexico;conflict
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:13:28:26],00;14;14;23,"And I tell you that they made so much commotion. You know, when the war ended in 1918, there was whistles and people making a lot of noise, and she went to to the Mexicans and told them, you know, you know what? They didn't know what was going on. And she explained to them, we're real happy now because our war has ended, and that's why we're all so happy.",conflict
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:13:51:28],00;14;41;24,"My mother used to tell me that into Mrs. Pearce went and told the Mexican people what was going on at the end of the war, and after that, my mother used to say, see, some of them went back to Mexico, some of these Mexicans went back and others didn't go see, my mother didn't go back. And then after my dad out of jail on the railroad, well, then we figured that was a steady job.",family;mexico;conflict;railroads and transportation
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:14:18:24],00;14;53;06,"Good. And, you know, we didn't have to worry. And then we just stayed there and birth. And that's where we were all born there and went to school there.",education

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:14:34:19],00;15;18;06,"Yes. I remember my mother took me the first day by the hand to the first grade, and I just stayed there. And no, the people were nice to us. I don't, I can't complain about that. We were the only Mexican family. But like I say, we had company from Pocatello. They'd go, president, but they never mistreated us in any way.",family;education;mexico;pocatello

Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:15:36:13],00;16;25;02,"And every Christmas I remember they'd always bring us the things for Christmas. And they tell us so.

Do you know you could very well have brought those presents here, but we would get presents from everywhere in the church.",religion
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:16:02:06],00;16;45;27,"We didn't socialize with them. But I'm not saying we were invited to other things. We were the only Mexican family.

Are you playing the drums in the Lutheran church or something?",mexico;family;religion
Mrs. Juanita Zazueta Huerta,[00:16:22:27],00;17;07;12,"You know, teasing them because I tell you that we that we joined all the churches, but we didn't.

There was the Presbyterian Church, but not Catholic.",religion
