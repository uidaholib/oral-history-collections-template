    "description": "This presentation explores the unique history of the Basques from the late 19th century to today, their global immigration, and their impact on communities, especially in Idaho. Attendees will learn about Spain and France before mass Basque emigration, the region’s transformation into a major tourist destination, and the hardships Basques faced during the immigration process. The talk will highlight their perseverance in establishing communities across the western U.S. and their lasting impact on local culture. The Basque Museum & Cultural Center preserves and shares these stories to connect people of all backgrounds and celebrate the dignity of the human experience. Bio: Annie, a fourth-generation Basque-American, was born and raised on a cattle ranch in Paradise Valley, Nevada. She attended a small three-room grade school before continuing her education in Winnemucca. Active in student leadership and athletics, she carried that passion to Boise State University, earning a degree in Spanish with minors in Basque Studies and Business. She joined the Oinkari Basque Dancers, serving as a board member, dance director, and liaison for a decade. Her deep connections with Boise’s Basque community led to study, travel, and work opportunities in the Basque Block. Since college, Annie has worked in education and became the Education Program Specialist at the Basque Museum & Cultural Center in 2013. In 2016, she was appointed Executive Director, continuing the mission of preserving, promoting, and perpetuating Basque history and culture for future generations.",
