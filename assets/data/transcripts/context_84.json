    "description": "This talk examines the Native Hawaiian struggle for land, sovereignty, and community empowerment over the past 50 years, situating it within the broader indigenous civil rights movement in the U.S. Native Hawaiian activists drew inspiration from the American Indian Movement, joining a larger fight against settler-colonial dispossession. Over time, solidarity between Native Hawaiians and Native Americans grew. Hawaiian activists supported the Standing Rock protests in 2016, opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline, while Native American activists backed the Mauna Kea protests in 2018-2019, even staging demonstrations on the mainland. These connections highlight a shared fight for indigenous rights. Bio: Dr. Erik Hadley earned his BA in History from the University of Montana and his MA and PhD from the University at Buffalo, specializing in Early Modern Europe and the Atlantic World. He is a lecturer in the History Department at Boise State University, teaching medieval and early modern European history as well as Atlantic and Pacific World histories. His research focuses on cultural history, particularly folkloric rituals, identity, and public commemoration in Western Europe and indigenous communities in the Americas and Hawai’i. Dr. Hadley was awarded a 2019-2020 Fulbright Research U.S. Scholar grant to Belgium, where he studied the historical evolution and public memory of UNESCO-recognized folkloric festivals dating back to the late Middle Ages. He has authored numerous articles on cultural identity in French-speaking Belgium.",
