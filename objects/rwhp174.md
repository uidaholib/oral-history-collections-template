00;14;45;12 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Other than I.

00;14;48;11 - Gale Anderson: Recall. And then they went, but the very normal long going along, they made a. Okay. why don't you start out by just kind of running through and telling me about your life there? It was kind of in chronological order.

00;15;11;25 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Some of the major events.

00;15;24;11 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: And,

00;15;34;00 - Gale Anderson: Well, I it go back to, How about you? I know another I think it was in car. that they having, Or it was, special. Great. because it was a great week in Seattle. I never forget that. And, I just kind of. She she is older than I am, so, we had a great time, and she, you know, some fellow that used to take care.

00;16;18;04 - Gale Anderson: And he was on there growing at the time, and, that's that was always, when I was in Hawaii, I did not want to go out in and that was the only trip I've ever been. and other than because it was so much fun, things that I didn't want, it was a quote. Yeah. And, so that was, that was kind of a hard for a little while before we were born employers.

00;16;51;15 - Gale Anderson: But we weren't at home. Yet I was there again. So, you know, they always were. I thought, oh, yes, it was, there was,

00;17;05;25 - Gale Anderson: I have talked to my mother about that. and I don't know much about that, but so and of course, I don't recall or traumas, as I recall, was the only one that I that. But anyway, of course it's in the forum, but, I can't thank you. I mean, there's nothing very interesting. When you are there.

00;17;41;05 - Gale Anderson: So when you were little, would you like to work? Play with dolls and people? Oh, I always had to play work on for quite some of the children for.

00;18;04;17 - Gale Anderson: And then finally moved down here. We, we moved up the river from. And so we were pretty busy. Where we had tours to do, which is great. Why did you do that? for quite a few. I think they had some room to do something that moved out there, and that was perfect. So they broke up. They came up here for your father's concert?

00;18;44;02 - Gale Anderson: Yeah. Yeah. He came. he he came for the furniture and, A town and the bills. he came in the boxcar all the way from Nebraska, and they went on a big break. But one who? And in, he put in the dirt away of one car and couldn't see the side in the wall.

00;19;22;24 - Gale Anderson: So that had come through right before the train, and, had been there for a long time. And yes, I do, I, I would, I would like to tell him because, I can break that down, but that that I, you. Well, he get to ride it and you know, even have friends that are there. He could a cow but he got do that was a good.

00;19;58;19 - Gale Anderson: So. Oh, yeah. Had the reason I went to school or not. Everybody in the country there.

00;20;14;19 - Gale Anderson: a lot of the people that live up there in still good friend.

00;20;23;11 - Gale Anderson: They call my sister, they go to high school.

00;20;30;06 - Gale Anderson: And during high school and go. I'm and high school. But. you can go on that thing. I don't know if we have any more fun than kids do nowadays, but then, like, you know, is that from. We are more,

00;20;50;06 - Gale Anderson: Ordinary people. That would look for them and bring them out for additional work. So, you know, there's a good thing over there. so, Oh, yeah, those are fun because I.

00;21;10;16 - Gale Anderson: Went back to visit relatives who were in Omaha and enjoyed that. But, I mean, the. foreman went back. I know when we didn't go back there, and that wasn't my time.

00;21;33;10 - Gale Anderson: Some part of the relatives, etc.. Remember them trying, and, I was just going to go up on that thing and I could, I could either have a new pair of shoes or I could try and go. I or what they do, but that's my upper right. And the boy. my my, my, that old and the crazy.

00;22;05;17 - Gale Anderson: But, Oh, yeah. It was always of great interest to him. And my sister and I went to, the third degree and she was going to teach in, in the North Down. And so I was impressed right here. So I went to bring it this summer and, it was the first time we'd ever been away together.

00;22;38;15 - Gale Anderson: So it was great at the same course. And then we didn't have time because she was going to take up, you know, miles to be teachers. And I was teaching in primary first grade. So, but she, but I go to different things. from my career and, it was good to be away from that.

00;23;09;23 - Gale Anderson: She was good. She always went, oh, yeah. And she just exchanged top 30. She. But she and it's been visiting her because she is, are in the same range. I was always the one that stays at home. You always wanted to. Now I never did. I wanted to, the things that I really wanted to do was to,

00;23;41;23 - Gale Anderson: play the organ and theater. At the time I graduated from high school, that was the thing. And we would go and play in the closet, so it. Yeah, well, I'm going to get started because I sold tickets at the Front Row Theater down here for years, and I was in high school. And the woman that put your and down there was, you know, so I had to play the organ and of course, I could play the piano, but I've never played an organ before.

00;24;12;04 - Gale Anderson: And, this was really a pipe organ. And, so I was so excited about the treatment. Oh, okay. And I tried that, and I hurt and took the organ, but. And, I always said I was kind of behind the eight ball on everything that I was. It was one of the first university I would like to hit, but, public school in and it was a two year course that you that.

00;24;45;03 - Gale Anderson: So I took, music videos. and I.

00;24;56;24 - Gale Anderson: But that year. Made it four year course. A lot of lemonade. Made a horrendous to come out of Spokane, Oregon. And I. And then the town came in. So that eliminated me from there. And so finally in 99, I was were back then, we all lived in Omaha. This is when I decided, well. I didn't want to do anything else, but.

00;25;32;20 - Gale Anderson: That was still working.

00;25;38;02 - Gale Anderson: And the farm and everything before I was active and everything was exceptional. So about.

00;25;49;22 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: What I have year.

00;25;52;00 - Gale Anderson: Why did you go to school? Where the. Because I had to work. I had to work and grow you on right away. Yeah, yeah, but but you did know because to go and. Well, I, but I went to school, I, I borrowed money from and married my sister. Because I was a temp, I was a four year university and I bought them to go to school.

00;26;27;28 - Gale Anderson: So let's see how good from us. And two. But the four summers were that I was teaching for, and I go back to my husband, back to and I went back and got my degree. I almost had to because of the oh my. So because I, I got married, I got eight years and and I got. I was there if you ever called.

00;27;05;09 - Gale Anderson: Yes, I did and tried every place I calling and and this thing or is it. No, no, I I taught it in, a lot of high school, for two years in Newport, Washington. When I first started teaching. my older, second grade. And I had music in the, in my own part that they, that I had in the fourth and sixth, seventh and, and then they in the band because I, when I was in high school, I had played my dad, Malcolm, and I could play Van Horn and, then I had a stroke or and I have a girl.

00;27;56;11 - Gale Anderson: Of course, that's what I do. I rallied my ended up in the group and, I remember, you know, 3:00 in the morning grading papers for them, preparing to. I.

00;28;16;19 - Gale Anderson: My girlfriend come some out from under a rock the next morning. The.

00;28;24;26 - Gale Anderson: Premier was facing. Well, sorry to have some band and you know and they come and kill person and I had to come back back in high school and that was the, you know, them. And then sometimes when I'm on the bus or.

00;28;50;21 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I go back.

00;28;54;07 - Gale Anderson: They wouldn't do it. Now. They didn't do it. I did this two years, but I had some I, some. Because, Van Horn. Yeah. And these, these things up there, I just caught up there in the band and we broke down from that point, and we ended musical contests that they had. And now that all schools ended over there and and came, you know.

00;29;33;10 - Gale Anderson: And this year,

00;29;37;14 - Gale Anderson: Hum. But you wouldn't have done it in class 7 or 8 years. I wouldn't have never heard of them. They were taking great memories. And yes, I've been there before. Of which one were married. No I didn't, that was the thing. Well, I, I did too, because I taught one year, I lived off a carpet a really very good working.

00;30;01;29 - Gale Anderson: And I remember sitting up there and, so this was, How I came back down here. It was mother and dad passed away, and, you know, they here in private work up the river, 19 years. And the one year I did do. And, then when he was ill, I could not do. But then I went back and we had three times.

00;30;38;29 - Gale Anderson: With your father, Bill, before. And we do a very fun period when he first came here for work and so this is only one person there right now because we had to day places in town and they get them on the block, a little house on the back of a river, you know, for and it took a long time because he did it when they were working on my them and after.

00;31;08;21 - Gale Anderson: So this them this is home. I guess these are my first. The government taken from Jesus river. It's like the old river here. they're could. How do. The,

00;31;32;04 - Gale Anderson: And so I guess I could. I could.

00;31;40;07 - Gale Anderson: Comfort it with the for the town. And you can always say you like you can't have a Catholic where they can't. And their worry about each one of them.

00;31;56;18 - Gale Anderson: From. What? Your first years are going to be harder to know. Are you there? Are you here really? For about say, first? Oh, maybe six years was very different. Yeah. So the children, were entirely different. They were in different. They.

00;32;29;12 - Gale Anderson: Well, for one thing.

00;32;35;19 - Gale Anderson: Just read here more. his parents. had more education that high school. And that meant he and both of them were sent to be outstanding people. And so, I don't know, it was, it was a different type of people were very. And they were eager and willing and,

00;33;09;12 - Gale Anderson: Well, he didn't want. And then.

00;33;15;21 - Gale Anderson: Here we go. And, and I can see it was in long that they're trying to go back and do some of the things that we experimented with to and the in the early 30s, that didn't work very gradually. And the long while, we're not others. What were some of the things that you experiment when they're coming out here?

00;33;47;06 - Gale Anderson: Oh, was this,

00;33;52;24 - Gale Anderson: All the set up of,

00;33;57;22 - Gale Anderson: I just didn't put a time. Yeah, that they let him. But he was very, very bright. He was over ten years ready. Well, that is true. And so, after school and then back to become bigger and, five and 30 and, and once he came back and, I didn't have any basic raiders we had to start, was pretty fresh and safe, and, it turned out to be better.

00;34;38;17 - Gale Anderson: So, because it's pretty bad they had to scrape. I think the kids worked and that they had to make up their, stories to read. And, because I knew the words while I was in the basic Raiders that we had out to try and get these children to say these were so that they would recognize them, that I knew that and and put those kids back into the Raiders as soon as I possibly could.

00;35;07;14 - Gale Anderson: They have to be. And, Chapter you have to do that and have to drill.

00;35;17;16 - Gale Anderson: And that was like a great expression. And they built a little house, we got furniture and we did everything under the sun. Of course, it was, a lot of us integrated, but, I still couldn't see my family. And I love them. I even got music later. I would bring the piano, and and our children would have a chance of trying to learn to drive to our home during our music period.

00;35;50;28 - Gale Anderson: Okay, great. Would you take your or. Yeah. Well, it's part of the. But I decided I was going to go out. That's what's comfortable on okay. But, in the last time so I think but I think they didn't get a chance to handle. Well, this is what I never known for. I not not and that that they would go on while they were in the high school.

00;36;23;08 - Gale Anderson: And I could tell they I just don't know. I have often wondered about that, too. But then I have them for about 1500 minutes and maybe you can't get too much from oh yeah, the gracious, hello. This is from having to meet your husband. He came here. After World War two and went to the Foreign service. And the county agent.

00;37;01;04 - Gale Anderson: I go on campus. Some of them now. he works as the, man out of school and service and everything. And so we're blind, and, they were kind of howling together, and so everybody congregated the bowling alley, right? And they used to go, I think we became acquainted with, was.

00;37;35;00 - Gale Anderson: Or something. I should thank that.

00;37;40;26 - Gale Anderson: Sneaks up on I don't know, I mean, you really weren't thinking about, you know, I was too busy or parents and, and, coming home from the fires and.

00;37;57;05 - Gale Anderson: But then, with them, the person of. I like the. Yeah. Or you or anybody else. I guess you're trying. They're just they're just must have had to be or something because it of course it been, partner all those years and and they just had no one to tell where I was going or anything. And because I always didn't get them, but now that it was that I was there, if I had to go to a meeting or something, maybe because I always wanted the I Army, I am a county superintendent meeting someone there in the alley and the time, but no longer an operation.

00;38;51;25 - Gale Anderson: And so,

00;38;55;06 - Gale Anderson: But I always told them where I was going, no matter where they were, they. Yeah. Yeah. So I've always that, That's what I can understand. Well, kids nowadays have to have their own apartments. I basically, because I enjoy being home 100 in Oak Park on Saturday, Sunday in the training, I was a cleaning boy.

00;39;21;03 - Gale Anderson: And captain to go, well, you're my daughter, right? I mean that in my car.

00;39;29;09 - Gale Anderson: I guess we all understand the folks like that family, and we take my my with every place. the four of us take a lot of relatives, and I cook for all that down there. So I don't always with them.

00;39;51;21 - Gale Anderson: Well, we enjoyed our little family. I always had fun together with my.

00;40;02;10 - Gale Anderson: Okay. The most exciting thing that ever happened to me was, was the road course. I was very happy to get married because the people in the community could come at you on the map. were they anxious for you to get married? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. They were all looking for somebody for me. And I always got to go ahead because,

00;40;27;18 - Gale Anderson: Have you always made the remark that the. Well, he was Elizabeth Hagler's husband?

00;40;38;10 - Gale Anderson: Everyone in the studio purchased everyone they people in town, mostly in the army, because they couldn't remember my everything. They had known me by my maiden name so darn long, and people still said the other day, one of the girls said, I have to tell you, before I start in on what I want to tell you was that,

00;41;07;09 - Gale Anderson: I looked through the photographs and I could not find our house, so, I don't I don't think I forgot I am president of the. And I. Oh, I guess I am. I have been told under all that aren't think they're just crazy, but,

00;41;32;13 - Gale Anderson: I don't know what, but I was. I say that the most exciting thing.

00;41;39;21 - Gale Anderson: Was in, I see it was in 73. My sister and I went to Europe. I when I married and expressed to her, it's just like a dream now. It was just wonderful. I never in all my life thought I'd ever make it. I'm going to have to wait to long. Oh, where did you get to go?

00;42;06;25 - Gale Anderson: well, we started out in London. That's our place. And they were. We were, but that was plenty. There's lots of, exciting things to see because, I did. And how did we get to see the Stonehenge that day? It's about 100 miles from London, I guess. But there were just no tours. And on the weekend for the.

00;42;36;09 - Gale Anderson: So I don't want to have to go back. Sometimes you. Then we went to Amsterdam and to, The Hague in front of. And, Went on down the Rhine. We went through Cologne, some of the places we didn't have very much time. Say, you know, I guess it was a blast. And.

00;43;11;05 - Gale Anderson: I would say to Germany and, we got in to, Czechoslovakia and, Excuse me.

00;43;30;18 - Gale Anderson: I know.

00;43;36;23 - Gale Anderson: Was there any particular place that you'd been looking forward to going to? Well, not really, I hadn't, because, but I think the really the, the highlight of it was let's go back to my sense again, was the fact that when she was in high school, she took two years of French, way back then, in those days, early 20s, that French teacher were really way out because they had these penthouse and my sister had caught fire.

00;44;12;16 - Gale Anderson: The French girl and woman, for over 50 years. so, when she, when I got something was at home, when she. No one knew we were gonna go in there. Why? She wrote to her that she didn't know that she'd be available or not. So this was the same to me. That was so exciting for the fact that one, because we went to Czechoslovakia.

00;44;48;11 - Gale Anderson: I mean, we were in, I mean, Yugoslavia, we were in Yugoslavia, they were around, Italy and, destinations, around where we were going to take a train on the go, narrow gauge trains. And it was like riding a bucking bronco as you went up through the Alps. There was the town of New York and, this woman has lived there all her life.

00;45;22;21 - Gale Anderson: And, so she met the train. And of course, my sister had never seen that, never met. And it was really something after all these years, 50 years. Very. And the things that they had would have a chance to, to meet and for each other. And then, of course, finding where, just it got to the point where it was maybe at Christmas time or something like that, that was all.

00;45;51;13 - Gale Anderson: And of course, now she just, so glad we got there. The thing to me was the fact that we got into a genuine French home, and it was upstairs and all these funny little buildings that the not very fancy looking from the outside, but it was very well organized on the inside. And, her husband had,

00;46;22;03 - Gale Anderson: Been living for some time and, she had this Isabel, who was her housekeeper, and Isabelle had some. And thank goodness he could speak English, but we could interpret because that road would get so exciting and more exciting. She had the higher pitch for her voice, and she talked so fast and couldn't remember French. was something, but they had, they had lunch already for.

00;47;02;24 - Gale Anderson: And that to me, it was it was just fantastic because everything was here bad. Still and that of and of course, later. But you only had a small portion. But it was just delightful after that. and so you and so, that she, she showed us around the town, and then we went back to days.

00;47;31;26 - Gale Anderson: And then the next day, our bus went right there. Yeah, well, the director said that, devices that ran a front seat to the. But and she said, he wondered if he would stop if Rose was there. go ahead.

00;47;59;00 - Gale Anderson: We're talking about the bus driver. Oh, yes. The bus driver went to the, her director said, no, we couldn't stop. But the bus driver, we're a. Oh, sorry, my honey, the here's the here's that.

00;48;18;16 - Gale Anderson: Oh, he was a handsome man. he had family, and he was from from Amsterdam. But he was a wonderful bus driver. And he did more for something trips. And I are glad that because it was the first time for him and, so the guy went to the back of the back and honey says, if she's on the bridge, I'll stop.

00;48;45;09 - Gale Anderson: And actually, she stopped and, right. And he stopped and got up. And then, of course, Dirk, our director, got off an organization and proceeded to in and we could speak French and, in the hotel, several languages in the car. And so it was great because he was in there because she said to her room and everybody in the bus had their noses up against the window because they'd heard us talking about roles and, can't remember where our last name was.

00;49;19;14 - Gale Anderson: Doesn't matter. But, there were all excited about it and they way better. So it was great. So that was that was really a wonderful trip. And we went on up to Switzerland and, and then over to Paris. Just had a wonderful time. We were gone 30 days then had to go from Paris to back to London and then from London.

00;49;50;01 - Gale Anderson: come. And that was really, and I'm ready to go and I'm ready to go again. and I was going to go again. Yes, I'm sure she is. But the thing is, is everything's fine. Know, and. And it was, it was, not too bad, but I'm glad we didn't like a lot of people said, oh, where are you going to go for now?

00;50;19;14 - Gale Anderson: Because the devaluation of the dollar allowed for worse now. And moreover. So, and they are calling it for prices over there, but this is an American Express tour. And I would go with them again because it was I, I ruined everything if it weren't for you could have asked for more. And so I was very open for it.

00;50;48;06 - Gale Anderson: I'm all for these tours because when you go by yourself, you wait too much time coming for a place to stay and hunting for the things to look at. And this way, the bus driver take us and each big city we were in. We were provided with a local tour guide person. The most massive scale and by you that the work there was great.

00;51;17;24 - Gale Anderson: I had reached that had one of those things, but my husband, caught all the babble and whatnot. But then I had to keep suffocating to get something out because it my every. We tried to write down what we had seen and there was thinking, okay, so worry about that time that you couldn't hardly remember the time. But if you write a little bit, there is some paper there.

00;51;44;19 - Gale Anderson: And so, the that we've worked together, you know, on I thought that might of getting about seven that never did or that maybe walk around the city a little bit just by the hotel and, and then we'd have to get up and go by 6:00 in the morning. But great, because you put it together what both of you wrote together.

00;52;14;12 - Gale Anderson: Oh, no, no, no, she, she put hers into a notebook thing, but I didn't mind. I didn't, and she had the slides, and I had the press, so I didn't know.

00;52;31;14 - Gale Anderson: But it's, That was. Of course, I enjoyed the trip to Hawaii. Now I want to go again to that part. So, uncle, George, that I can understand. And now that. Oh, my lord, that. Throw that stop over there. Oh, wonderful. Why, I'd like to go and see the. Cottage.

00;53;07;07 - Gale Anderson: What year was there for? A quarter. I was in from 1939 to 48. During the war years. That was the last part. And I was to because it was, so we had around us then we're women, children and old men. so and it was very difficult for anybody for teach because a lot of the women run out of the factories there.

00;53;42;19 - Gale Anderson: I mean, like the boring and very.

00;53;52;03 - Gale Anderson: We didn't appropriately, we had to take the people out there, maybe had, six weeks court and, and, education way back when. Pretty special school think because of the college. Well, then was that,

00;54;19;09 - Gale Anderson: The superintendent that was in what I want to call. Great. Right. And then in the summer of 39. was not well at summer. Let them run away and, then that friend of mine, that would have been my friends who want to talk about Avery. I know they got the Swanson passed away, and they put the screen in, and I think he was there for about a month.

00;54;57;22 - Gale Anderson: And he just couldn't stand it. And so, of course, my sister had been encouraging them to, but, he'd been earlier not sure if she was. I think 35 or so, 36 was her last year, so. And, well, somebody said to me I was in bed, but my room and everyone. Oh, I don't know, I didn't, because I was enjoying to man, I so I did.

00;55;35;19 - Gale Anderson: Yeah, I was quite I think there was 9:00 trying to get all of the job, and I was so lucky. One girl. So I had them and I knew over a long time, but, I figured, well, but I had to do all the, the bookwork for the district, I mean, for the, different school district, the trustees that do that.

00;56;06;29 - Gale Anderson: But, we we financial. Yeah, there it is. And, I couldn't be bothered making out the report, and I had to have. So, you know, you spoiled people by doing things because I read about them each year. Well, after you and for that long time, it, it was routine. More. And of course, I had to go off and separate.

00;56;37;25 - Gale Anderson: Teacher and most of the maturities and my teachers and you if you remember school year. Yes, I did, and those were some of the kids that were sent over to come during the current. One, because the teachers do that come. Well, kids, I like came to the office and some of them weren't prepared to do it. So I did.

00;57;12;00 - Gale Anderson: And then after I got and was from then, along along the years and when the racial lines were becoming to the front. But and I got interested in there. Yeah, but I can't do it for the county. And, and I used to get films from university governors here and various places around, and, the fall of the year and have teachers manage and the teachers would cry and cry in their unit.

00;57;55;23 - Gale Anderson: That they wanted to go out and let me know work and, and, and then I would try and find a film. But we couldn't do that because they didn't have that to make, you know, the country school. But and, yeah. So when I did find a film, I would notify them, and try and get it. They would put their, their units down so there was more or less following one another than so that I would be able to set up the viewing time for.

00;58;30;07 - Gale Anderson: And so it would set that I think film, the kids and help me set up, get her. And the teachers interviewed, for example, the managers of grades because they didn't have even a little first rate environment. you know, which was great because, That's why I'm here. But I just wanted to have everybody go out.

00;59;02;15 - Gale Anderson: This is their. Their biggest is she is active. She got here today right around time to let me, But she was what I was she who, when I went arrived, she had everything on the board of questions on the board, the things that they might want to see or that might be on a picture because they had movies, of course.

00;59;24;09 - Gale Anderson: And cheerleader. Oh. And, quick lesson, kids, that, it worked out well because then, after I had children, because there's only do about 15, 30 minutes. with the railroad and realizing that they would just get to go over all of them. But it was a little bit get there. I was going a bit too fast, you know, so it was good because.

00;59;55;12 - Gale Anderson: And there were also intense. There wasn't any horsing around or anything. It was great. Just a wonderful. What do you think the girls down that, what did you do? Horsing around in the chamber with their car. They're not interested in over what's going on. This is one that is very good one. And the third home of the.

01;00;25;01 - Gale Anderson: Because they just aren't interested. And so you don't have very strong here. But this is Christmas so that I really run it and they did take and then again it's it's a picture to it. That's the they, they get some of these pictures figures that and then they would get out of teaching the class and I would take them unless they had a unit, them because it wasn't the picture show.

01;00;56;07 - Gale Anderson: So, well, that to me that's, it sounds were just by the book. the class thing was on and that when I read it. But there were going to look at it, and I know that some of them, some of those pictures that.

01;01;18;20 - Gale Anderson: title with. Did you, do you were going to wear on the thing that was so we in the rural school, we had to follow along with the state state board of Education. We had set up the things, but, something like this. this was on my own, of course. I think the review was about on the first, come up with it, but I enjoyed that.

01;01;51;11 - Gale Anderson: And that is, of course, that, that is you. And the was on the corner with five that you see that the children started cheering. But anyhow, because I was so excited about it and, And then, well, I'm from I am. I think it probably started up to work the super that we had here was, interested in one thing that I.

01;02;26;04 - Gale Anderson: Because we had purchased from the Saint Mary's district and, I think in preschool down year, he would bring the, down and, to write the book is very strong. And, so I don't know if I know. And so this is the now the. No, I, I still think that you when need these calculators, these little hand calculators, they have I, I think getting a design get the idea and what I like it I don't know it's something I figured after that and I decided for the first time so.

01;03;07;24 - Gale Anderson: Well anyhow, they, a lot of them I think that that would be very good for a children to have that, that they would love to track more, but they have to know how to, because it's not that they don't know that a baby is the it's just knows that I'll show it on.

01;03;34;26 - Gale Anderson: And that's okay. I have a little excavator that I work I work that program with. I mean into that. Yeah. so first we did it. Had time with the. Oh, I don't know what grade, fifth grade or something like that. And that they used to make that the kids would start trying to figure it out, you know, figure out the answer for that work.

01;04;00;05 - Gale Anderson: And that way they were asked to do, so those calculators, most there were so that. Yeah. Yes, I know that that's true. That's true. But I don't know how you operate this from now. We're fairly certain we have from the top. Oh, I see.

01;04;26;05 - Gale Anderson: And you, we go toward the center for the track. I do, and then it's in the red. Take it away from the center. That he said that everything worked out pretty well. Well, for heaven's sake.

01;04;49;17 - Gale Anderson: Well, I didn't say that the. The things, device. Are good.

01;05;04;11 - Gale Anderson: Because if if the child is smart enough, he's going to have to go there. And he. It's on sideways because you you kind of have to know at least you have to do a little calculating there and find out what it is. And.

01;05;23;10 - Gale Anderson: So, oh, I have all kinds of things that a lot of our preschool center, I went back teaching, He was he did more for the training show. Right. And the grades school down here than any principal he had for a long time, because he had didn't have a machine. And, I mean, there was a grade.

01;05;50;05 - Gale Anderson: We had this language mastery thing that I made cards for, phonics. And they had to run that thing. I had a demo tape of the base of a card. It was running a flash card, and, so they could play very. They could look at the card, listen to it, and sometimes I would have them say it before the room lesson, read the read the word like card and work the sound of the vowel.

01;06;28;14 - Gale Anderson: And then they could record that in the machine and would record on the base of the tape. So, and I could take the card that they did and say what they had done. And then again, for the credit, they were to look at the card, listen to it, and then they would say it, and then they'd listen to their and see if they said it.

01;06;55;15 - Gale Anderson: Right. So it was, it was something or very particular program. They got control last primary teacher I taught first in the second grade mastery the year. Sorry. Passed away. I thought I was going to have second grade. but the superintendent had, teacher, another teacher. She had never got and was, an opening in the fifth grade.

01;07;27;05 - Gale Anderson: So the first thing that, and I would note on it, because I had to pay. The kid who.

01;07;45;12 - Gale Anderson: I figured 18 years beat him. That her. but it just seemed to me that,

01;07;56;29 - Gale Anderson: That all of her devices that we had and math that that. Oh, my gosh, the kids had fun with that. Or what did. Oh, this was, it could the numbers, they had a tape with, Recognition problems and subtraction and, you right that on the screen and they had to write down the answers and,

01;08;36;13 - Gale Anderson: But this was this was in the lower grade.

01;08;41;05 - Gale Anderson: And we had more fun with it because they would them there were ten. Ten combinations. culture. No one that I mean, they had one section and, I think there are 50, called temperature here and there. Two and. Oh, boy, talk about concentration. Some of those kids were just great because they they you could you do it that they and, but they had to be looking.

01;09;12;26 - Gale Anderson: It's, to get so expensive, you can't stand it because it is fair. It's a big, fat fantastic. And I was getting some love letter kind of sent him and all of around a bit before it, before I got the back room back then. And of course, after they get used to it now was that was it, was it.

01;09;33;23 - Gale Anderson: And they have we good going and how many inches they did get right. Because they had the, the ten. We'd always go back and say because it gave them the fellowship. So that was, that was a really good one. But they couldn't enjoy it. And so, some of them, it's one for kids. Did you do a teacher.

01;10;00;21 - Gale Anderson: Or probably reading? I don't know, cause I love science. I had lots of fun. One of the kids, and, Well, I have one in my my Disney, except her, I had to bend over backwards to get that thing in and never do anything that was that was more weakness. and I never was. And,

01;10;33;29 - Gale Anderson: So I have 2 or 3, and, and they, they want to be bothered or something. I don't, I don't know if that's time to. Deal with them. to integrate the consciousness, the subject we had last year and I. And that was always fun. We had prepared the to the library and to the city hall, to the fire trucks.

01;11;06;02 - Gale Anderson: And my dad down there got very proficient with little kids. So the first they could take photos ahead and you could stand there, look at it funny. They get down the drink it, give them some something of interest about their truck and what they did and what the city did for the city government. Did you ever think about having your own children and for everyone to get married earlier and have children?

01;11;36;10 - Gale Anderson: Well, yes, I suppose I did know in the early the early days, probably out of high school, but I don't know. I was too busy having fun and working and everything and never occurred to me. Because we were always doing things that belonged to baby that really don't know all these meetings. And I. I was in some fancy group, part of me that were were rather because you get two and the, the two independent.

01;12;08;16 - Gale Anderson: Oh they did or you and your husband adjusted to being married didn't you. Oh yes. Yes it was, it was good for me. Oh I'm good. You know, we got very, perma about two years. but there was just one of them. I mean, there was never any word past, we couldn't get married because we had to wait until Thanksgiving or we were married on Thanksgiving Day because he couldn't before that, because of a fire season.

01;12;40;10 - Gale Anderson: And after that, and I guess because it was election lot of, it was election year. And I tried to get out of the job, but they wouldn't let me out. So I had to run for them.

01;12;52;13 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Yes. And so was there.

01;12;58;04 - Gale Anderson: Did you have a having better. No. Than very much. Moreover Seattle I was living in Seattle and because her husband was over in Korea and because, you know, we were having and so we went over there on the weekend and, and because I had to come back because if over. So, so I had to help. but after I'd given up my job, but I met with them.

01;13;34;00 - Gale Anderson: The time that we had, we had come together over in matter. though, as you said, we were at the same vintage.

01;13;44;13 - Gale Anderson: Thing of it. But we went down and we always had to take a vacation in the spring, like February, right, later that year. And so that in some sense like bring the date now because, but that's the only time I could take it because he couldn't take in the 70th birthday. I always had to be around the station.

01;14;11;14 - Gale Anderson: And, even though no one here when I lived on Round Mountain, which is way back up in there. but no medication at all in summertime, because he, he was the ranger that year in the interest is there hardly move up but 42 point we a carpenter two and a half years and then moved down here. Then in the summertime when he was up around out for two summers and then, to say that there was great.

01;14;46;22 - Gale Anderson: they had a Delco system, a pretty good you like, in the early part of the evening, and, they turn a valve. I guess I could turn it down because I wanted to lodge and knock on the door work. Otherwise there was no room, no telephone, no radio.

01;15;06;28 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Nothing. In this phone call.

01;15;14;02 - Gale Anderson: On. And you spend your days while you're up there? Well, I am, back on birds. And so I had more fun walking around, and I was there looking for bird. And I found lots of them that I had them. And then there were a couple bases with a local bird. I go out in the morning for a couple of hours and then back in, and they put them in my refrigerator because it had some freezer, and I'm gonna go back out in the afternoon.

01;15;49;01 - Gale Anderson: Nobody could go with me because the gals were they had cookouts or too busy, they couldn't leave. And but I had to go, had to go on them for them to get in the berries and make some gas for busy. But. So I took my sewing machine out there on travels. One for fun and good. I loved that and I would have loved to have been, out for I don't mind being around, say, this is my.

01;16;27;19 - Gale Anderson: This has been one of my problems. I could shut out the rest of the world because they got old. And things I like to do. If I had some problem, well, I don't I kind of have to to, Act like a human being. It.

01;16;50;04 - Gale Anderson: Because once in a while, I don't make friends. And I enjoy. But, I mean, that's is something I have. I've always been more or less or more. I know that, you know, it's, I've had to work in. Enforcement when I had fun. But that was fun. You were something else again. So, Well, it was flavorsome.

01;17;21;27 - Gale Anderson: You know, it was good for me.

01;17;27;19 - Gale Anderson: To get, by somebody else. Good. But that's that's the psychology, I guess. and, I have no answer, but San Diego and, my my sister Mary was, stationed in Washington, DC. We go back there in January for Eisenhower's inauguration. I don't I don't ever forget that it's from that.

01;18;02;22 - Gale Anderson: They have a gal who lives here now, working. And, I've seen her work.

01;18;13;23 - Gale Anderson: Who the senator represented there was at the time.

01;18;21;27 - Gale Anderson: But anyhow, she lives here. And the she was working for him, and she had tickets for for me. But there was a ringer, Harry. And they wanted to see it, too. And finally she got some residents, walking through. She was building civic, Hall. That was that was really something in valor, which is another organization from an earlier by, I get it through a lot of that.

01;18;51;15 - Gale Anderson: They get things that they have. They have if you carry your your lunch in your hot hand. Because believe me, when you want to see the parade, you get on the bench, you know, you see, like, from, about 1:00 until six. Or otherwise, you wouldn't get a see. That's the good and. Well, certainly I can do some.

01;19;19;28 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Of that down.

01;19;24;04 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: With Birmingham.

01;19;25;08 - Gale Anderson: Yeah. Colored toy around the. Come on. For for, I've been there long enough that, She know her way around and, I don't know something I always said that she should have been a guide because she gets there. That you.

01;19;55;02 - Gale Anderson: Raise up the. Oh, yeah. This year. I have one to go. I can't wait for it to get here. there. 17. Is this April? Is are you really close to your sister? Yeah, it's very. That's true. I know we've really had fun together. And them. Oh, I've done in fact, I've never done with anybody except going down a trip that my mother.

01;20;23;00 - Gale Anderson: And so that's why she's coming down with the clam. Some sort of trip. I don't know where, but. And maybe Harry will go and he doesn't really care about him, and he's buried somewhere right into his house. So he makes. sure. Well, I don't know if the.

01;20;48;06 - Gale Anderson: I don't know.

01;20;49;10 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: If they know.

01;20;54;10 - Gale Anderson: And, So, Day by day, getting slower and slower. It can't do the work fast. I used to, we did this weekly. Said, what do you think? Really advanced the benefits of living in a small town or rural areas? Well, I think the advantage, that, It's cheaper living in the first place. And, we're close enough to Spokane and Portland the way that the thing, and a culture of things like we can get to.

01;21;40;11 - Gale Anderson: Except, now they have the opera house in Spokane. Urban easier. But, is the only good thing here in the water, and you can't get in there. But we managed to get into a few, and, and then right here, I mean, they, could have lived here for so long that,

01;22;03;28 - Gale Anderson: I know a lot of people, but, it's getting to the point where there are more than one living in that. I don't know, but you have these friends that have lived here, and they have practically no, knowing. And so now that and so it's, it's fine. Neighbors. my neighbor down below here. When my mother was ill, I was teaching private, about his mother.

01;22;39;26 - Gale Anderson: I know because my mother not allowed us to have to be bedridden or anything like that. She could be out. But I always wondered if she'd fall or something, you know? And, I know that my neighbor over here would come over, and she came over many times a day. I would see for several years just to check them out as they how she would.

01;23;06;29 - Gale Anderson: And I knew that if there was something radically wrong, that she would come so I could dismiss that from my mind and go on and, for more than everybody was your friends. You are. You are, I'm not alone, but I can. I can still be alone here. Like, lock the doors. Nobody can get me. I mean, you could be by yourself, and that's.

01;23;42;12 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Can you think of any disadvantages?

01;23;45;25 - Gale Anderson: Well, of course, the disadvantages, I say is, are any of those big cultural things that you want to do? That's. That, to me, is the most, and right now, to get wearing apparel or shoes. I never have been able to buy shoes here. And so it's always such a focus because I can't get them and start reading.

01;24;13;14 - Gale Anderson: So and in Spokane, I have to go and cook in there for a month. But, but, I don't know anything else. we have good doctors here.

01;24;33;06 - Gale Anderson: It's very, very frequent. And, I can't see anything wrong with it. There are some people who I wouldn't. They have to go to Spokane. But then that's been. I like to have. Of course. for furniture, a big thing. You know, if you can get however, TV's and and, my phonograph, I get you anything that I can.

01;25;03;20 - Gale Anderson: I like to hear. Because then when you have repairs, you don't like that? I think you you watch TV very much or not? Not a lot. What kind of shows that you are? Oh. Oh, I like Baretta. Oh, yeah, I got, I, well, I like the animal shows. The, Except right now we're getting all the reruns, but any of those are by, because those shows and the national hallmark always get some good ones.

01;25;42;18 - Gale Anderson: and, don't know. And I but I have never gotten so I'm looking at everybody said, oh, the today show.

01;25;50;21 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Or some of the morning. Oh, I don't want to.

01;25;55;25 - Gale Anderson: Get cold in the morning. And I, you know. Almost everybody I've ever come back very quick is down.

01;26;05;26 - Gale Anderson: They do go watch the, you know like Animal Kingdom. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's. For seven is a good one too. They have some nice shows. seven. I heard that they're coming.

01;26;28;15 - Gale Anderson: But,

01;26;32;18 - Gale Anderson: Oh, it's some that are searchers. Them, and they just wonder what I do to where to get up and turn the day. Are what these papers are magazine grinding. Where are you? Right there. as the grass raising. So, and, and book records, I don't know the geographic. And I've gotten books from the geographic, and, and I have all kinds of Seidenberg.

01;27;08;27 - Gale Anderson: Are coming out. I ears. It's like the book in Atlanta from, American Garden. You, I well, I do I like them.

01;27;24;15 - Gale Anderson: But then I wanted to. When I've got some travel magazines that I don't have, I get the the magazine American Express can't travel on vacation. And then I belong to the, to that and jam and the and the National travel.

01;27;49;02 - Gale Anderson: Company. And I get a magazine, travel. That's great. Oh, it has some good articles. And then I, I read them. Can hardly stand that. I'm on a book. I really like my travel books. I do. What part of the United States anything. Well, that I mean, to Washington. mean I never been in the southern states. And there's a certain kind of thing about going and, to go on a far from where.

01;28;25;05 - Gale Anderson: Well, you know, so this is the thing, but we're kind of on the set up now. it's pretty hot. Oh, I'm. It's going okay. Oh, well, we were thinking maybe September. October, September is still pretty hot, isn't? Yeah. I'd hate to, I don't remember. Is that really is it burning even around Halloween? It's kind of give or take.

01;28;57;13 - Gale Anderson: It may or may not be hot. Oh, really hot in September, I'm sure you put this camera on. if we were close, facilities or something like, Well, this is it. Because you have to go out there, but because you have the people now. And people. I don't know if they could take the, kind of an anything.

01;29;26;03 - Gale Anderson: look, I can't get very excited to see. Yeah. Where did they live? Texas. And, down around, Dallas on there. And then. Then there's some friend that let them declare some place in Alabama. I don't know which city, but, Then they go there. And so there's these people. You like that place? Yes, I do, I mean, I don't even like to go around, but I like terrible to be that way.

01;30;07;00 - Gale Anderson: But, more. So I don't know what we're going to do about having a California. Man in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana.

01;30;24;19 - Gale Anderson: Through the Midwest. I have been in Kansas, and no friends like that you don't really know much about. Yeah. And the is, When I came back, it was. Well, we didn't get, you know, we came back from Washington. That was to get back as best they could because he had to get back to work. and so, there was kind of a hurry to deal.

01;31;04;05 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I don't know, more.

01;31;09;25 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Have you always.

01;31;10;09 - Gale Anderson: Had a garden in front for. Well, I didn't know what I was going to have. And then another. And that they have that, I took over and she could no longer do it. And so this is it because I. And I thoroughly enjoy it. And something about the gardening and the dirt gets to you about like, golf.

01;31;37;04 - Gale Anderson: I like to play golf, too, but it's, something again, I'm. And, the, the athletic type at all, but I do like to read flowers mostly. Yes. To vegetable. Yeah, well, I suppose if I have space, I wouldn't have raised them and didn't care. Everybody thinks I'm busy and I know I they think it's a matter of high school to let go.

01;32;04;04 - Gale Anderson: And then I could see I've got the meaning. I've got three cans or getting them and, two cucumbers and one who cares? And one would be. And they look at the local park to get.

01;32;26;00 - Gale Anderson: So and I read them front of magazines, I read my front garden tells me to put them in, but it was nice. So I did good. Have you ever camping over? A little bit? Not too much, I suppose I had, I've been married longer and have I had a family or something because my mother. But, for one person that doesn't work.

01;32;56;16 - Gale Anderson: I really. It's very expensive when you have to, especially when you have to raise or when you have to buy everything you can generate and find. But I just simply don't have enough space in the yard. And to say this, this, or they might be there to grow or ripen or not, but, I appreciated that. But I know mother always had a very presence.

01;33;25;07 - Gale Anderson: So you always there. She, Right. Celery. And it take it very long to mature here. Where? Well, I can't remember that because, I was just a kid when she was doing that, and I know it wasn't always that. It was something. And she had such a big garden and everything, but, I had some great little.

01;33;50;17 - Gale Anderson: I don't remember about her celery, but, yeah, she she was real happy with it and all.

01;33;59;19 - Gale Anderson: I don't know, and but I than that I don't I wasn't that great. If I had babysat and everything because tourists care. The beans and lettuce and their garden. And my neighbor up here does. She has more. She doesn't have a garage on her lot, so she can have no backyard and say, we completely understand. Wonderful. It's a tender.

01;34;28;01 - Gale Anderson: I'm going break that down. you have a garden. Oh, I don't know. There's something about it. And then that this is the it just something for, you know, and and, her dreams are amazing. And some of the things that I think I become interesting out in the air, then come in and they come back. I think so.

01;35;02;05 - Gale Anderson: But I think that's what what I know is to, But I used to go for we were married this long cabbage family, and you and I have to go work in the background for the farmers who are about 5:00. And I think that I was right about that. Quick gardening would have done the same for me, but I didn't garden it.

01;35;25;11 - Gale Anderson: You get out there like a vegetable, try to hit the ball, and, I finish my. You forget about all the worries that you had about the day and my job and worry about what other people or relaxation down. I have to go from there for about two days. I hated that remind me of my husband, but he really he was determined.

01;36;02;02 - Gale Anderson: So he was a member of the. So we'll have everybody. But he wasn't the best dancer in the world. But but boy, I gave him my forever. And, at least getting out on the farm trying to.

01;36;25;01 - Gale Anderson: Get worked up. But I was always fun. I always wanted. So you threw it out for a summertime. But I had to leave, and I had that family down there.

01;36;44;16 - Gale Anderson: My three year old, the kids from college in those days. I don't know what those are. Now. Fire interest from.

01;37;00;18 - Gale Anderson: From. What do you do for a Christian now?

01;37;05;13 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I'm traveling, and you're going,

01;37;12;07 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Well, I'm.

01;37;14;05 - Gale Anderson: A little bit of all. I am golf now, but, Okay. And we're redoing our course. Have been over a years, have gone on a golf and. But they're good. Fine. And, Some summer we have gone down to the university, a bunch of us to go to the summer theater, which we enjoyed very much.

01;37;41;04 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: and, Oh, I don't know.

01;37;48;13 - Gale Anderson: Anymore teams like that, I never have to mow the lawn. You know, I didn't have time for anything. I mean, as far as any any. Well, you don't go on picnics anymore. Oh, I have a family here. is retired dentist.

01;38;14;02 - Gale Anderson: They like to give us a grant to the backwoods. And I know I did hear some. Whenever they do. And my neighbors would go, Huckleberry, go back every in. And this year we were forced to go way back. And they had a lot to things. Go. Can't get to the lake because it's way down deep and I'm not about to climb a mountain.

01;38;37;13 - Gale Anderson: But, I want to go back either fishing, and stuff like this. So, I don't know if it is. Well, that's not my own. Don't you want to go in the woods and watch the birds? Prefer banjo. I found the other rock. I'm talking about camping. Well, I did that when I was young, and. Maybe if I had a camper and the I.

01;39;14;04 - Gale Anderson: But that's out as far as I'm concerned. I've done that. But one wanted more.

01;39;22;27 - Gale Anderson: Go! I said, you bet on your life. No, it really didn't. I was teaching at Avery at the time. And, that's the cool thing is, I don't know if that's bad for a small place because, There were for our teacher. The superintendent taught, there was two years of high school up there, and, that and there was a gal at seventh, and they and my roommate, said, since they don't want that, they and I talked to my friend, and I only had my children and, the school I didn't bring the teacher and, practices.

01;40;16;16 - Gale Anderson: So we had off and I'm getting kind of. Across our way in Vegas. But right next door? I don't think so. Anyhow, the first year. We didn't pay your rent, but we pay the utility.

01;40;41;14 - Gale Anderson: I think we did two paid. And then the second year, the board came to us and said, the land is we will have to eliminate one teacher. Or if if you want to take a 16 to 30% cut, we can retain that for the remainder of. Well, we knew who was going to be playing the role of the gal or taking the stones.

01;41;17;17 - Gale Anderson: And they said, because it's happening to do that. And why should we? All right. Hurt. So we just took that and they didn't charge us that thing for living. And that teacher personality is wonderful. Some of the bad old ways. And when I when we get our paycheck the same as it had been the year before.

01;41;45;26 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: so we complain.

01;41;49;03 - Gale Anderson: So that because that was way back when, it was only on a limited basis, but nevertheless we had we had one I did not have. I was not without a job. I work for. I started teaching in 30, in the fall of 30. And I continue that. Because the war have a bigger effect on your life? No, because there was none.

01;42;14;23 - Gale Anderson: None that anyone in my family, my immediate family or any of my relatives because I knew that were affected by surgery. Today.

01;42;31;04 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I don't not aware of that.

01;42;47;04 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: the common.

01;42;48;08 - Gale Anderson: Things your husband and your family, when you're very.

01;42;59;09 - Gale Anderson: Worried about major surgery? If you talk about those your age, when they go. Oh, it was the only thing that I can think of was that, and that we had decided that, since we were born so independent and awful. That there was any difference. And we'd sit down and talk it out like two normal adults.

01;43;28;09 - Gale Anderson: That's 110. Otherwise, I got on an airplane. It was easy to cook for him. He loved to try anything. So I had a moral. I first started to cooking. I think it should go through the cookbook quick off. Anything cooked. And other than that, think after teaching all those years work, what was it like then to be at home?

01;43;57;17 - Gale Anderson: Well, I enjoyed it to see because there were things that I could do that I had to have a chance to do, such as cooking and, and, normal summer time. I did more sewing. However, when I before that, I always did fancy work. I did, I did and crocheted and did all that. But, I had time to, to sew, make jacket for myself or for rest and, and things like that.

01;44;30;07 - Gale Anderson: And, that was, that was something different. But, I don't remember that going down. And I had the mother drive me the, you know, just for it had this misstatement. But other than that was quite a and it was regular production line drive. And there was a reason for that eighth grade. But he was good at putting it on because it made it tight.

01;45;07;02 - Gale Anderson: but I kept the strips and tape for mom and.

01;45;14;23 - Gale Anderson: Boy or something. And then he spun it right up the back road. But you just felt like you and he just couldn't breathe. I mean, the Goodyear on the hard for him. He took the covers, the backs over the cookhouse and the the gals over there. And he said that when you go over the house and see the the it should look like this, but doesn't.

01;45;46;02 - Gale Anderson: Just it. But, But he had fun. When you started teaching again, when you're ready to start back or. Well, I was just very happy that I was able to go back to teaching because, and there's only been such a few years that I had to say that it was, I wasn't much of a lot of men in there because we're only married seven and a half years, and and,

01;46;16;14 - Gale Anderson: And I just didn't like that. because I got one of those and a different one. Yeah, but I was. Yes. I was just happy to get back, to have something interested in. But it.

01;46;39;15 - Gale Anderson: Was different again because it was, Well, you have to have some, faith that you just can't go on. And I think these people that have nothing that have never worked or done anything like that is terrible. Must be terrible because you you, get to feel sorry for yourself and all that. It's it's not any good.

01;47;07;15 - Gale Anderson: So I was so busy that, Because at the time, you guys remember, it was able to. I used to go. It was in Spokane. I wasn't reservations that year, but, I would drive in to Spokane and see him and come back that day, and, there's just, you know, there's someone looking over you and helping you out because,

01;47;37;10 - Gale Anderson: To go knowing that I never knew what I was going to find another one in there, and I never knew what I was going, finally came home.

01;47;45;05 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I never did find anything like that.

01;47;47;03 - Gale Anderson: Well, so, I mean, it was I could keep going. It's that extra strength that's given to you.

01;47;55;26 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: So. I don't know,

01;48;02;08 - Gale Anderson: And then I started to get back into the intimidating, nervous.

01;48;10;20 - Gale Anderson: Oh, do I have to do it? But now that I retired, seemed same time it's come to it. And and, that part, I quit. He said. How long you've been retired? This is going on my fourth year. roughly. Right. Oh, no. No, really. And and I've been the really busy because it just seems like all these organizations.

01;48;37;09 - Gale Anderson: And I can't say no, I'm going to to learn. Yes, I am secretary of the country club, the Lady's Country Club, which is a bridge. That and it's always a skill thing because way back when, when I started, they had they did meet, at the country club. And I don't think any of them women ever played golf.

01;49;05;28 - Gale Anderson: For friends. The bridge. I'm not that good a bridge player, and I never when I was teaching, to me, it was the last thing I wanted to do was to play card.

01;49;23;19 - Gale Anderson: Certain play bridge. because I always felt the correcting papers and making up for school or so wasting my time. And I feel the same way today because I'd rather be home looking at these magazines, not being there. My dad that's sitting in a smoke filled room and I'm a I'm a reformed smoker. I can't hardly tolerate it anymore.

01;49;57;16 - Gale Anderson: But I want them to to quit. Or probably six year. But, And all the battle I know with them.

01;50;10;23 - Gale Anderson: Have. No, I just don't care for the average player. But are you just secretary? But but you actually don't put in there for. Well, I, I go, it's fine. And a lot of time they because again get out to run. But I enjoy being with some of those women. And again that's something that she couldn't care less about, which is true of anything.

01;50;40;12 - Gale Anderson: But, But I have to know that that is something I have to do.

01;50;50;26 - Gale Anderson: Because it seems to continue for, the older. There's never anything that happened time. So. 135 in terms of that seconds, and sort of that population, I know years ago.

01;51;08;01 - Gale Anderson: I don't and maybe I don't ever when but, I don't know. It's some of those women would never miss.

01;51;21;28 - Gale Anderson: They go there twice a month because they're on to Oregonian breakfast and they go there. And as far as I'm aware that they.

01;51;37;16 - Gale Anderson: In the summer, during the summertime potluck. And so everybody has some area. Yeah. So I shouldn't I'm joined again. But. It's I love I enjoy no trouble whatever that's on. Have I ever see them because people don't get together unless it's a close friend. The two, the calls a day or what I call more red coat, different.

01;52;14;02 - Gale Anderson: But, We're better. Omega. But my girlfriend, I have known better all my life.

01;52;24;10 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: And from my basement.

01;52;32;08 - Gale Anderson: So hot I can harvest and, I don't see, I believe that our third one, where they wouldn't cut down on any of the potlucks and with the price of food.

01;52;49;22 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: They they have. I don't know.

01;52;57;09 - Gale Anderson: If I'm wrong. I may have something wrong. Wrong. Right, right.

01;53;02;27 - Gale Anderson: But I don't know.

01;53;07;08 - Gale Anderson: I can't figure that one out. Is there anything else you want to add? Maybe, maybe something about your mother that you think is important or just any area to be have about politics or teaching or being married or something like that.

01;53;28;27 - Gale Anderson: Well, I'm go back to my mother. Here was a very good mother. She, was a very guiding mother. not one of these pushy one. That was she working hard. You were going well. No, just just, when I was in high school, that and for a couple of years or so. But she was always home for that.

01;53;51;28 - Gale Anderson: How do you feel about working mothers? Well, I haven't been a primary teacher. I think that they should stay home and look in your face in the bathroom because they need them. Those little things they their mothers. And that some baby sitter. Do you actually notice the difference in the children? Oh, yes. Sure you do. Because most kids, when their mothers work, there's no, they have nothing.

01;54;29;08 - Gale Anderson: There's nothing. very few mothers have time to work for the child, and they're really know what the what they're little kids doing. And so, yes, when they get home, they're, they're, they're getting in better. And Republicans control them to move, to get out of their hair. it's it's, it's very apparent. And I think. And the way they grow kids, they, I just kind of have to work by themselves.

01;55;03;19 - Gale Anderson: And of course, those this they tend to work in where they kitchens run in their home. Right. That's where I feel. So I, I've always found that I think they should I think their places are no. Until a family no less willing to take care of themselves. and your mother and father for.

01;55;26;24 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: You to go on after. Yeah. You. We always have.

01;55;33;10 - Gale Anderson: And I think there's. And I know, know now from, from my father that I have, that I learned more things when we lived on a farm about birds and trees that I went to have parents buy. I have been doing, and I didn't realize it until I took botany at university. And I know are they common names for the head of the family botanical name, but nevertheless I never the flowers, and I only I know of who my dad and I never realized that he liked.

01;56;11;23 - Gale Anderson: Branches. They're just. You're growing up. Did he specifically take you out? And I'll tell you those things. Unless you brought them in. Unless we brought the flowers in or something. I don't remember, but I never realized how many I know that was a thing. And it wasn't mother. That's, that, this is, okay. What would you say is the greatest effect that your mother had.

01;56;40;08 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: In your life?

01;56;44;21 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I don't know, yeah, I know.

01;56;50;08 - Gale Anderson: That could be that question. Yeah, I don't know, because, when you when you needed her, she was there. I mean, for any problems you might have, or she was always. You could always discuss. So, I don't know. I mean, I don't, I can't answer that would be fine. Well, we'll say what they have do. I mean, because that's my word.

01;57;19;04 - Gale Anderson: That's from the family. I think. Because then they were interested in what they were doing. But that was, always were, and I can't remember any specific thing at all, because it's the same in a way that the.

01;57;40;06 - Gale Anderson: You know, there were some rules and you abided by them. Do that. But, you said you're from the person and we're interested in what you're doing. What about with the children that you were teaching? We had that same feeling that your fathers were really interested in working in. So, there's always some, you know, there's a there's always have to be some, but I don't know until the last, probably 2 or 3 years that I was teaching, did I ever have a father come to me?

01;58;11;28 - Gale Anderson: And I tell you, I got to understand that I was so happy I did that. It just seemed to me it was just great to have a father come to school and visit. You mean all that time? All that time? Never had any. It. Well, if you ever contact this parent teacher contact. Well, I always had to contact their mother.

01;58;32;20 - Gale Anderson: Did the father was working or else it was. I would send a letter home and suppose that they get they both get it. And a hundred. In the last few years they've been having these parent teacher conferences. this is where I was supposed to it, correct. It was hard to schedule so that, a father could come or something.

01;59;01;25 - Gale Anderson: I mean, he could get away, but then some jobs. I mean, after all, this is a mill town, and they can't just say, well, I'm going to school for business adventures and see what my kids do. so, because if we don't want to replace him at that moment, maybe he was a failure or something. And if he had to stay there time and so this is the thing.

01;59;26;16 - Gale Anderson: But, and again, some stuff to do, but, I don't know anymore. I did what I said, the children that I had and,

01;59;42;07 - Gale Anderson: And of course, I still say before the war that the parents were more interested in. Maybe it was because of the depression. The kids are at home and there was more things done at home. So there's there's a whole family with more families there because it didn't have any money doing the out. And that after the war cry, everybody was out for a flying or something.

02;00;11;04 - Gale Anderson: I don't. And, did you have a job and pick up the pieces? I guess. But,

02;00;23;25 - Gale Anderson: Anyway, for my own kids and nobody home when they get home. Everybody tired? Where are you with it? Is. And then looking out for a good time and some in the babysitter. And so we get very good babysitter.

02;00;42;12 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: And I think it.

02;00;49;05 - Gale Anderson: That's my that's my idea. And then I live here and I've always found that they get them from kids from the and I had a chance.

02;01;04;15 - Gale Anderson: I never did, but I get Romanian boy. You got him. He, or he was abandoned and the kids were playing on a playground after. Or they were in the room. They had to wait for the bus after school, but they had been playing at recess, and, I don't know, they were. They always congregate around the bench that have help, correct papers and things like that.

02;01;34;09 - Gale Anderson: But you. So anyhow, somebody said, so, so I had some awful bad words on the playground, and I very had, some you shouldn't say them. And their little boy said.

02;01;54;13 - Gale Anderson: Crying my my my, my about the some, Kids. Some of those some seven year old, He said I don't like in.

02;02;13;18 - Gale Anderson: I could cry because I know that that family.

02;02;21;10 - Gale Anderson: girl, I has a girl. Very soon after, she stammers so terribly and they lose their mother and.

02;02;31;03 - Gale Anderson: They just hide under the house in America for no one. The.

02;02;44;09 - Gale Anderson: But he was one of the thousands of kids who, That was because he was he was very conscious of the fact that they were. And then. And I always want to know how they're going to get through getting along with the other kids.

02;03;02;15 - Gale Anderson: You know, I'm going to tell him my it will pass. And but I didn't that they always think that the, the teachers of the first grade grades should be for secrecy.

02;03;18;13 - Gale Anderson: And junior, I will see him in everything and.

02;03;24;05 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Oh, boy, you really do,

02;03;29;11 - Gale Anderson: So the they we have that.

02;03;36;20 - Gale Anderson: Awful.

02;03;42;06 - Gale Anderson: Fear. Of course. I mean, I must be and, all of the parents, there's that one that were just real good. Where when you send them at home, if you make an effort to find those parents. If I could. But sometimes it was impossible. You they. I mean, after all, when the father has to work and lots of times that, some of these people that I'm checked or something, they said, look, it's hard, it's hard to contact both that really I know that.

02;04;15;05 - Gale Anderson: And, as I say, this, this one guy in German is there in go to Mr.. Yeah. And I was on the doctor, which I was do I was in come and a oh my God, I can go to that. But yes. I don't know him. I think they could have of other days. they could have they had one of the.

02;04;48;08 - Gale Anderson: but I didn't enjoy the they did not work. And then and even though it was just a one parent way, he learned a great deal about the child and and that aside, you don't seem to go to those reference. So you can turn around, turn it off.

02;05;12;16 - Gale Anderson: And say many of your old. Or once in a while. Well, or some hear you say that they talk to their mom, that, but yeah, not the beginning. The third generation.

02;05;31;20 - Gale Anderson: But it was definitely, prior to it hit the mark. So that was true, that, that I don't regret that I was and teaching has been just great for me, and I had enjoyed it even though I hadn't wanted to. And, It, it was very good for me. It was a good livelihood. And, now I'm reaping the benefits of retirement and having a good time to learn to wonderful and and they have a lot of room for teachers when you're a teacher.

02;06;12;04 - Gale Anderson: I only at the beginning because, you know. Well, you were the first one that I do remember. This was from the Jeannie. some of them, they were not, And recommend you if you had if you could get involved here and I.

02;06;35;19 - Gale Anderson: And you didn't. There's no cause that was adopted. whatever. Scarboro that was that just for women or for them? For women. When they always discriminated against women?

02;06;55;17 - Gale Anderson: things like that. They still, teaching. They still.

02;07;03;21 - Gale Anderson: Salary. Why?

02;07;09;21 - Gale Anderson: Six in my group, we. I guess you're ready to be right.

02;07;21;16 - Gale Anderson: Really? Well, I don't care whether or not, because some of them I don't, don't approve of at all, but I see equal pay for equal job, and they simply not do when you pay. Because I think that this, you know. No, because I didn't have my degrees, and, I did, well, I had probably two and a half years of school because that's when I was in the office.

02;07;50;02 - Gale Anderson: I, I mean, every summer we, kind of took them and we have courses that I earned. I don't know how many credit in that. I in the years that I was in. They aren't what you say. So it was it was good. It wasn't good fun. But, no, I wasn't getting even as much as the, by the time.

02;08;17;21 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: The prosecuting attorney, the we.

02;08;28;20 - Gale Anderson: Or anything about them at the time. Now, he was suddenly trying to say it was the end and that there was a local. I mean, I was an elective job, and,

02;08;42;10 - Gale Anderson: Given their own law work, and he had no education because I had and very minor cases, but he was getting more regular, and he had a secretary, and I didn't really think it was that true among the teachers, too? Yeah. That's what about with education. Is that case for the same reason? The number of years to the man always there, by the way, has it killed us now?

02;09;18;01 - Gale Anderson: They can sit there and say, but it is not true because they can manage to do this business under the table. how do they do that? We're like for, for basically sure. Any of these people were the bus driver, the coaches, they know they figures and they were they have then they have to pay their prices or they get paid extra.

02;09;47;06 - Gale Anderson: Is elementary teachers. And as a get kicked on there is because they have to do all they, they do have they.

02;10;04;20 - Gale Anderson: Have they, we have the lesson learned in college, in spite of all and the all clear to Yakima on that, committee border. Area. And I was in Fresno. I was actually prepared. But I'm one of the, probably the major administrative. And I'm also. I'm on the division advisory board to that side, and and I'm a two time with all of the people.

02;10;33;26 - Gale Anderson: I think. Coming up. And how do you have time to do this myself? I don't have time to talk about my neighbors. I have and I don't like to throw clubs. You know, they run like last week, I traveled from and I drove a scrap car. I was gone in, my lady, my first in that. So I drove over Thursday afternoon and had a making friends.

02;11;06;00 - Gale Anderson: And then I drove back, back to work for six hours. But I go to Boise because I'm on the plane. I catch a long term, for I live here about ten, but I am back in the same area. Maybe I catch the 5:00 and then get back and go down 530 with about, and I can't afford to go.

02;11;31;24 - Gale Anderson: It is after assignment, however, you. sometimes wonder if you could get back to do anything chronic for 36 hours. Does that really take. I mean, are you working like, a lot, really long hours during this disaster? Oh, my. Yeah. I'm a disaster now. I will go back to the sunshine. Mine.

02;12;01;05 - Gale Anderson: We, cross over. It was very traumatic for, our site director brother. Thank you. Thanks for traveling so fast. When I was there, it wasn't something that you could say, you know, even anticipate. And, so I have 2 or 3. It's in about 36. but you get 30 and get 30. And I had delegated, very good people work very fine people to work with.

02;12;31;09 - Gale Anderson: And, but I all these people who are in power back and so I'm here, I can partner more. And I was at sleep for hours at a stretch, and I slept in my car for 43 back. I had a place I could stay, but it wasn't that demand, and I needed to be out there right when I came home the first time, it was only 45 miles after my husband.

02;12;54;25 - Gale Anderson: I can't go out and get a hundred miles back, but I had my freedom back. And then I stay up and foot around for people and it was a very nasty, cold, rainy. And so I was going to learn about for a year, a free, probably and free for our district just by and, and recovery. And it seemed to be important to be up at night.

02;13;24;29 - Gale Anderson: So then, the daytime ladies would come on and, and then I ran up by, four hours sleep for that 12 day and take about an hour and a half the, in the afternoon, my car. But my car, my whole. And when I would sit and look for people, I just sit on a chair and prop back and take a look at that.

02;13;47;26 - Gale Anderson: But I'm one of those people are going to do that thing. Yeah. Period. That's your bag. Oh yeah. Yeah, I'd say, my gosh, I had to think that's that's very fair. we went to, I took about three hours sleep the night down here. Right. And the but then I took the map. I made myself leave the same and go to tomorrow.

02;14;14;00 - Gale Anderson: And after the after.

02;14;17;26 - Gale Anderson: And, but I knew that. And I had so long the need to sleep. Come on. What is your work name? Where you're coordinating the airport. I know well, we're down here. Yes. The coordinator, I, I have a name. but I can also do individual case work. I can do certain environmental studies that I can do, we've got a, what we are doing here at Saint Mary's, and I don't do this right anymore.

02;14;48;11 - Gale Anderson: We're here. You can't do this yourself. wonderful people to work as they. We're volunteers. It, you know, like I say, the Navy, you you, help that way. Because we can tell when the water is going up and I start watching this water come up. from the time I left and I have contact with the sheriff's office, and I said, look, come back 30 minutes up if you want me to come here.

02;15;18;19 - Gale Anderson: And I said, well, call back in 30 minute. We think so. You know, I was brought up, feeling operational. And so when I called back in three minutes, I said, yes, you get right in here to to work in a short distance of time from from the client didn't show up here, but by the time I got to town, the water started with the road.

02;15;41;22 - Gale Anderson: And so I stayed in there three weeks, and I just, stayed at the, our office was in the back of the Department of Health and Welfare was turned over to the library. After I stayed there, I had my first day, I've got a good night because I slept with my incredible so. And I have some work in here because, you see that little crater that down below here?

02;16;09;11 - Gale Anderson: I see a horse trainer down there in the field. What part of the highway traveling with field right down below. See, that's the first name. Okay. And again, if you look for I referred there in the little house down there. Right in that same field with the Holy Spirit. I can't I don't think that the right Howard terminal shed.

02;16;35;24 - Gale Anderson: Well, anyway, the water comes up through that little shack. That's a mineral house. And that was here. It usually comes up to that pile of, ground brush, but it was higher. But I don't know how high it was out here because I wasn't here. Yeah, but I have some farmland. But it doesn't serve your house or not.

02;16;57;09 - Gale Anderson: We're not living here. But anyway, so what we had going on was 24 hours, a freebie in the back quarters, and, we had a Red cross Model County, and it was driven by members of the corral. Of course, they were businessmen, but they died and they're paying for our dam, for our growth. And we've done the work I've worked with for hours, over four hours.

02;17;22;13 - Gale Anderson: I mean, sometimes a day and then some about that sort of we heard the radio broadcast, but this is somebody, you understand, they've really been here for, you know, hours. And they were just there, you know, but we had a local who reached out to that worker. They never got out from little Dog. They were sandbagged. But anyway, my operations there as I was over there.

02;17;52;15 - Gale Anderson: So record later for our life. And I had to get in during that. Had paid staff from the Red cross in here for one month. And, I had to make that work. Well, but we had real work and well, for many places, respect great and Red cross for every work of the federal disaster. And they have to pay for the family with you.

02;18;23;21 - Gale Anderson: Well, you have a case worker first. There's several phases, like the emergency phase of a disaster. And that is where everything was mass care and be people on a mass basis can take care of them on a mass basis. but then you get down to the individual case where the partners and the individual family, first of all, something they need collectively.

02;18;50;27 - Gale Anderson: Then what do they need individually? A lack of case worker. And you look at our we started this. People are in a food shock okay. Shock protect and quite a fire on here on the back. Broken some overlapping homes after probably about 100 people. Come have water up to the eaves for a month because it didn't drain. Oh, I didn't realize it was there that long I don't know.

02;19;20;21 - Gale Anderson: And that was but it was. After that went down, these two kids come in and I talked to one and that person, hey, for threatening for that company or something, come back and all.

02;19;37;00 - Gale Anderson: This kids.

02;19;40;14 - Gale Anderson: I heard it there. Yeah. Well I'm the one that was working on.

02;19;48;16 - Gale Anderson: let me go through here. Probably want to go over. That's good. So I, you know, if we could step to these questions instead of them going in to really what you're into, I don't think the energy is what they have to put. No, I believe in helping people to find themselves them in for work that, you know.

02;20;16;27 - Gale Anderson: You, what are some of the advantages and disadvantages.

02;20;20;26 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Of living in a rural area?

02;20;25;26 - Gale Anderson: But I don't know any disadvantages. But from what? From my point of view, there are no disadvantages. Because for all a lot life people. And I love people, but I also like my solitude. I like to be able to get away from people and, So I don't really see, I don't I've never left live. And I study.

02;21;00;14 - Gale Anderson: I don't like living from a block. And, so I don't see any different traffic.

02;21;14;07 - Gale Anderson: So benefits of living in a country are, the first person brought up three children, and they were never town oriented because they they don't like to go to town. And, prior to bringing up the children. And I like animal pride because it isn't living for me. And like, I have my animals throughout. And, I like personal freedom, and I like to observe nature.

02;21;43;15 - Gale Anderson: We prefer we watch the deer out that way. And I put a headboard against a bobcat that's Hoover and Park across the river and prefer a more thoughtful person. Deer come out an hour later. Our second night there was a bobcat, and then we have the osprey. And, But I like wildlife. I like the you or your husband.

02;22;08;12 - Gale Anderson: Her. But I happen to have a grandma. And, we could hear her, but yet I do not object to people hunting. They do. We kind of go along with this big movement they have. You see, our, the Bible says the seed and the fish of the fish of the sea and the foul the air will put on for people's benefit.

02;22;36;00 - Gale Anderson: Right. I believe that resources were put on earth for people to use, live like. So, I don't believe in having that part of life, but we. Whatever we have, we need, we use it all, but we're not wasteful. We don't fish just for the sport is for the sport that we all eat. Everything that we get, we don't believe in life for.

02;23;05;27 - Gale Anderson: But I have no desire to have. I sit here and they practice for pheasants. For 100 days. And then that turned me off, quite frankly. And I'm not quite paying, you know, 50, etc. and, we are citizens to say so territories and get us to do what we want. Quite gold cup. I feel good after the first and I just did it for five.

02;23;38;13 - Gale Anderson: Make it up four years on the ground. And then we have five deer running around here one year, and my husband's a hunter. When he got hurt, he was not a trophy hunter that year. And although we have people here who are trophy hunter and, I knew this five year would appeared. I had felt and I felt a five year myself almost daily.

02;24;05;28 - Gale Anderson: And during the hunting season and then Farmer Day and the kids would be out hunting and I had five years. I would be down here everyday and I just I just laughed about it because I thought I really got stuck around my love. My five year. Yeah. Nobody could ever seem last. five deer come in here every.

02;24;27;07 - Gale Anderson: I was almost every day during the incident. Let me down around the farm. Sometimes they that I had a real of, I. Because I survived they were mule deer, but I don't know where they went through what people were hunting for, but they seem to know when the hunters looked around, when they found the third party.

02;24;56;05 - Gale Anderson: one some of the things that you do for recreation now and if when you return. For the for recreation. My husband I, I like to go on the horse races. as I was growing up. What do you want to go on? Picnic and my parents. You to go camping. But now we are living here. Or we watch other people do that, right?

02;25;27;26 - Gale Anderson: We don't go camping because very, very, very important things that better right here where we're living because we have the hot and cold running water. I like, for recreation. I do like start, go grow up there. But I, I have real color TV. we enjoy the TV. we have, some people in for dinner, but I, for my recreation personally is combined with my.

02;26;01;10 - Gale Anderson: My husband is not one who cares to go. And a lot of recreation center more like, you know, fellowship program. That's that's probably for recreation. And I believe that my volunteering is a combined it's it's a recreation as well. as being helpful and constructive. Yes, I am also my change of pace is recreation.

02;26;37;11 - Gale Anderson: And, and my activities are recreation. I suppose I would have to call it that. What cook TV.

02;26;45;01 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Shows you are.

02;26;48;25 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I like.

02;26;51;06 - Gale Anderson: Director. I like those with the history background. And, certainly we find that, like, yesterday we watched the kangaroo. They have good theories of the wildlife. We're interested in wildlife and, more fact and fiction. My reading. I like to read, suspenseful. Romantic, historical. Not in a historical setting. Novel. Great. What about those things? I don't personally think I have bad books of them.

02;27;29;17 - Gale Anderson: They. I don't think in magazines. Well, we thank the Arabia for it. Perhaps we take for. But I found out I would rather buy a book because I like to read a whole book. than magazine. Because while we as we go for. Sale. as well as I buy now decided that my season is not a reservation.

02;28;01;08 - Gale Anderson: the family circle has an individual entrance, but I'm not one of these people who go and have buy and that is in, we're interested in newspapers. Some businesses. We have that kind of thing.

02;28;24;10 - Gale Anderson: when you are.

02;28;24;23 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Having your children for medical, for Covid.

02;28;30;20 - Gale Anderson: Well, that's what I had. My first brother. brother in law of the camera.

02;28;42;22 - Gale Anderson: Had a good doctor. That was a good thing. I did the corrals and hard labor for 14 hours. I have, I have good security. I feel very adequate. We're. You're in the hospital. What part of the hospital are asking the hospital for? For when you were born there. You're born here? I was born. My father delivered my older brother because it was the first time for him.

02;29;16;21 - Gale Anderson: And my older brother, who was a midwife for you. We had a doctor whose name was Doctor Shunk. I heard we have a doctor, so, I, I went through this year, brought two of my younger sisters, gentlemen in the black. They.

02;29;36;18 - Gale Anderson: This doctor shot to. I remember the day of childbirth. How pretty.

02;29;45;18 - Gale Anderson: Well, I said I grew up. In a large family. Then we all had animals, and we lived with our animal family from a very, very small calf because we always had many kidneys. And we had a calf. And so you learn these theories that are, we didn't talk about in our home a great deal. It should have no, but we did learn from the rather practical approach of our having many animals who were all stages of pregnancy and, cat the dog for the petting system can.

02;30;34;08 - Gale Anderson: Work for that. And I think that that it was a gradual type of thing. But as far as actual learning about acquired something that picked that back work, I was old enough. I was trying for my first.

02;30;52;02 - Gale Anderson: So, so it wasn't ready to. Mr.. What did you talk about? birds there, things with your shoulder, up to a certain I said I tried to do. I didn't really attempt to initiate conversations. they ask questions. I tried to answer them. And, here again, we always have had animals around, and, in fact, we have our casserole bird right now because it was so much easier.

02;31;29;15 - Gale Anderson: But in the beginning, we had a series of marketing. my children would be tightening their print, and we had one, that lavatory. So it just couldn't settle down and have those kittens unless you had somebody sitting looking. And it would be one of these would be a big plastic blaster salad. And so they would retain her pain for, you know, and she wouldn't stay in that box unless she had somebody sitting in with her.

02;32;05;20 - Gale Anderson: And I also, I still remember wrestling with this little kid, but nine years old. So I have quite.

02;32;16;21 - Gale Anderson: Her memories of children have not sleeping well, but if they ask questions, I answered them. And then remember we had, we had the books around as part of the initiating and carry out the details. I didn't.

02;32;38;06 - Gale Anderson: I just I didn't feel like I have been left out of too much. What? This is the number of.

02;32;44;14 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Children that you have. But effective.

02;32;49;27 - Gale Anderson: cervical rhythm. Because I have them. but they rest very after wrestling was born. I have them, an appendectomy and a hernia operation in July.

02;33;08;11 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: I had a, a hernia on how I.

02;33;11;06 - Gale Anderson: Was carrying him. And then I had blood clots. So and and so my back was born. I had my main strep through tough. Would you like to get more children? as I said, you know, I got some stuff. I'm quite happy with my three because my grandma and, I worked with many other children. I liked the children, but I wasn't really baby oriented.

02;33;39;21 - Gale Anderson: When children become part, become very, very interesting to me is from about six months because and then become I don't.

02;33;50;22 - Gale Anderson: Like too much help with little animals. I got grandchildren they have. Right. And then another one coming. They're actually very pretty. As I was growing out, I so.

02;34;06;02 - Gale Anderson: You know she's she's just she's the, you know, the most precious grandchild, very good natured girl. Did you encourage your children to go on the go round? Yes. Yes, indeed. But I mean, around here at one. So you do. But they didn't have to make decisions the first year. We we discouraged them from the from before they left because they should take the second grade.

02;34;37;14 - Gale Anderson: But we wanted them to know what they loved to do. Generally. But we waxes discourage them from trying to make informed decision. I changed my major three times and so, around here, yes, that were part of.

02;34;58;22 - Gale Anderson: The environment. If you could go. Yeah. What do you call what are you planning on that you could. Well, I kind of had problems. I had wanted to join the Army Nurse Corps. I mean, we. This is nurse to the department, and my mother took me out of here. It really wasn't so much in that respect, because I think I would have done really well in this, was.

02;35;30;18 - Gale Anderson: Which was during World War two. And so then the next thing I did, I was exposed and I was culturally oriented because I helped my father out. So I, I lost it. I hope it can be fun. I worked on Iraq and I work for 11, and I started off from university and, I wrote LED Horses to a fire when I was about 18 so that I really loved Take and culture, but that didn't seem to be really in my mind about work or any practical.

02;36;09;20 - Gale Anderson: so our first lady did not occasion. And I, bless him, I won't say may be for posterity. I won't say who it was, but it was right after lunch that our educational class, ever passed through my whole life. And, of course, I was working. I was working hard. I went through and I sat for two weeks and decided this for me.

02;36;43;18 - Gale Anderson: There are still out speaking, but I could not see myself sitting through that introduction to education. As a driver, I know that a teacher. So I, thought I was scared I was going to try transferability for cars, car driver culture curriculum concluded that you're in agriculture. And then I had these seven years and I think that it might be democratic.

02;37;13;09 - Gale Anderson: Somebody said, perhaps I'm not that I grew up. In but, I didn't have that thing in my mind what I wanted to do. What did you have? You really knew what you learned with it? I, I never used that. well, I think that back my children. I use the professional. Except that you want to go for Jedi.

02;37;40;02 - Gale Anderson: And I did some part time, agent work down here for my children. Had food allergies, and I really utilize utilization for my own use. And I have shared that with other people. If I were ever to have done a just look at that, food allergy because our children have food allergy. But I had our when we use the crops, were they tested for low levels?

02;38;10;08 - Gale Anderson: I never tested them for because I never had a test because of my training that I did my own a variety of good food. So in the summer, it was so, then. So then our, developed recipes and the farmer's food allergies, which we have our group that's been around and they changed, and I really didn't want to get them to always remember.

02;38;41;29 - Gale Anderson: That at the last thing I do, if to have them. But I was able to stay on top of but I would not have been able to have them. I had this doctor, but I've used.

02;38;54;23 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: A community service group so that.

02;38;59;21 - Gale Anderson: That I'm cooking forward to doing all of. That work.

02;39;12;08 - Gale Anderson: For training and and my desire to work. Are you go to church. I can my church. I used to out of back and I, I said I separate that three years from the man I married and but I want to go into a and, so then when I remarried, I was in. But I certainly did become a church in the meantime.

02;39;42;18 - Gale Anderson: But I consider myself a Catholic. So my children are not Catholic. They are physical. Right, with our husband? No, no, we're is proud of that. And he mama is not really pro Catholic.

02;40;05;07 - Gale Anderson: here. So, it's he's really not real church minded, but really, if I had, you know, the basis he plays in the. I say the Ten Commandments that all but try to keep only in my church area, you know that not formal church. Right. Become so yeah. I think when my children are locked up. That's why I call it a year for each child.

02;40;39;01 - Gale Anderson: I had gone to that church. And there wasn't a conflict of interest because I talked to a lot of children first, and I, I enjoyed it as a member of the body. And I thought for years, about one year for sure. I had said, your family had a lot of stuff to do. But my father, the Mormon, we have a.

02;41;10;07 - Gale Anderson: But they, we have Korean United brethren and Mormon, but have lived there. They have, Catholic. We have, that my parents were nondenominational. We went to Sunday school. They were not Catholic. That was a convert because I was there during the service. And, but they were Protestant. They are Catholic looking, you know, brother in Mormon. And then I had one brother who was a, an evangelist.

02;41;49;19 - Gale Anderson: So, yeah, we never were religious. Everybody each to each his own or. Is that is that something that your care, pastor. Yeah. We believe that people have the right to, We believe in love in the Bible and, people and our children first to read the Bible. And my children do read the Bible. Believe it or not.

02;42;18;22 - Gale Anderson: And, they participated. Well, I have to say, let me go back farther than this. Whenever I brought my children up. Graduate from school. I work in it, and, The base was from the schools. And then I saw in the literature I did not believe there's such a thing as a one world government. and it's it's similar.

02;42;54;19 - Gale Anderson: So much of the church literature, of course, in the heart. here again, it's everybody's concept. There is one world that is true, but I don't believe that it could, I would hate to think of that. And the prophecy and the,

02;43;17;18 - Gale Anderson: Oh, I like the politics and the empire building. If we were to ever come under one world government. But anyway, it seemed as much, the church material and the Sunday school material became that the overall, pretty much one world government, another quite alien to my independent soul. So I quite frankly stopped taking my children to Sunday school after church.

02;43;54;27 - Gale Anderson: And so there is the Bible. We were ever and they do read it. And then they also read when they got old enough that they capital of very strong church, that the prime. But I felt that the 30 churches and some schools were departing from religion, and I just felt that it was very, and no internal conflict there, a pacifistic point of view.

02;44;25;08 - Gale Anderson: And I and I felt sorry that in my mind, for a lot of years, the Bible from the macro. Read it and you make up your own mind and not be influenced by forces. But some from, you know, not far. But there are other people from other people's interpretations of our class. We don't trust the man in his, and many of the interpretations tend to be so suspicious.

02;44;58;09 - Gale Anderson: But at the stage of thoroughly suspicious of the motives of, of course, our educators, and from they think everybody is in all kinds of movement. I would like to call them communism I because I get so that that is the socialistic Luther moment. I socialistic.

02;45;24;08 - Gale Anderson: And I of your freedom of mind both.

02;45;30;09 - Gale Anderson: What do you think about the the welfare system?

02;45;34;12 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Not.

02;45;38;09 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Well, you know, I ran for.

02;45;39;17 - Gale Anderson: Office and I ran, the basis of for me. Right. Let me redraw.

02;45;49;23 - Gale Anderson: Now, I believe in giving help to the handicapped. I mean, you are giving assistance to the aid. I am giving a set of people who really need it. I came up in a family that was poor, but there was no such thing as welfare in our house. We lived, we had, we worked with, the had we had, we were brought up from out of the way.

02;46;24;01 - Gale Anderson: I was brought up. The welfare was to be on welfare. I was afraid of. Okay. You know, I feel that I'm carrying over so that I will not feel that the same thing for the elderly could really need help because they they just checked. They're living longer. They have to have. Yeah, but I think we should give it to them.

02;46;45;24 - Gale Anderson: I feel that the mail time they need the help they should have it. I feel that we should get a program, to help those who really are handicapped, who need it. But I would hope that our welfare is given in a constructive manner. Here again, I would hope you're not spreading salmonella cells. What else did you report?

02;47;10;19 - Gale Anderson: What? What office did you ask the state representative? I was the first woman from Belmont County, and I didn't lose. We were running again. It was put me on the same platform when Mr. Right. I don't think I would change it at all if I didn't run. It would be personal. And in fact, I. Am I have to become.

02;47;38;29 - Gale Anderson: You're probably just as well that I didn't run because the think you need to have somebody. I mean, I didn't live because I still am not a member of legislature, and, I can accomplish much by working on the outside and the people who live in the community and who will come forth. Well, I was surprised when I found.

02;48;02;26 - Gale Anderson: Right. Let's go back to the person. That, had a gun down there, 3000. Don't. So that we're going to call it that. Oh, my. I think it should be my. And not the fat part. Roller, That's what this is it. This is a report. Now, I don't know what to call an avid Romans liberal. I would I would like to have that right.

02;48;34;10 - Gale Anderson: Crime. I do not feel I'm in competition with any men. It's their problem as they feel I'm. And I am completely not a good person. I. I don't compete with anybody but myself. I, I am a woman libber to the crime here, but I feel that women should be able to develop themselves the maximum. And you'll be surprised to me that how much, ladies, a lot of women would have if they did not have to first consider a male ego.

02;49;15;13 - Gale Anderson: That, but they it a, you know, the King himself. I think that women took their next step. having their head in the sand. I don't like it that way. They some of them don't really care to get out and make the challenge. I, I believe that women as a whole have her past. I still think that there's not this equality.

02;49;44;03 - Gale Anderson: I think they have to work harder to achieve the same as a man. But I don't say I think that women should be able to be recognized. individual achievement. But yet I'm not a woman's lover. For those who wish to stay in the house of the mothers of stay in the house and fetch care of the babies and bridges for me about this.

02;50;11;19 - Gale Anderson: get all pregnant woman and not put me on the floor. Well, that's what I heard. But people like me. Thank goodness I have a husband who don't go. Who allows me to do this. But I don't feel when considering women who are able to do things that I don't expect of my husband, you know, when you're away, did your husband take care of your children?

02;50;39;10 - Gale Anderson: Well, we have a little son right now, of course, our brother. He is now almost 18. in the course of a few strong to a great deal. I even got into, fitness work out of self defense because he was gone so much and so forth. And yet. And he also was a man. I can't say he's that I social, but he was not a social and important to them.

02;51;08;16 - Gale Anderson: They and that I have a, I have a mind for created to sit in the car while I was in the house. I had had to have outlived. And so I became involved in community service. So yes, he did. He never took back picture. And he was that family. Did you have a good time?

02;51;32;27 - Gale Anderson: So what I would do, I generally would say I have maybe I could, yes he did, but had I not gone I would say Carol out of that, he would have been here to get my house. And so many of the, I had felt for many of the first for fellows that would come and go and I didn't have any, but I knew them because that was my only my first is that they couldn't get in the house, and that was really left because they were gone so much.

02;52;08;29 - Gale Anderson: But by God, I became involved. And I became involved quite heavily right in the beginning. And I was got time. He stayed half of the children. You they really got acquainted with proper and proper, got acquainted with children. And here's a fact for me about when I married. 41 oh 45 yeah. So, he did. Yes. And I could not do these things.

02;52;37;14 - Gale Anderson: Absolutely could not do them if he did not allow me, you know, if he crossed or or if his ego was involved. But we both do not leave this place at the same time. He had two brothers in Oregon. Back to the brothers. I stayed home.

02;52;58;26 - Gale Anderson: And take care of things, for he was gone. And he. This was a good, because in the beginning, my parents would come here and stay and, and then they became too elderly, and we didn't ever get anybody else. So I would stay and take care of the place for two week after week service, summer holiday would take the children and go to order with them.

02;53;23;15 - Gale Anderson: This was a great career for our group. And, I say, well, we work on a fishing trip for 30 days, but we broke from the first, so we cut.

02;53;38;24 - Gale Anderson: Because we were, you know, we're too close to the highway and we wouldn't have too much more fairly what was said back or say. And then open up so we don't have garage doors and then we can get out. You know, that's where we're getting out. You don't intend to, but let's at least expect something down the road.

02;54;03;19 - Gale Anderson: So if you ever have to go before camp. Have. And if you have animals, you have to take care of and you know. So, And who else would come and take care of three cat 3004 cat that people all. Profit. So I guess that's an advantage to every next door neighbor right next door. Didn't have so many people.

02;54;34;07 - Gale Anderson: Here we are. But yeah, that's gotta go. We don't go in. what are some of the most common things your husband asked you about? What happened to that?

02;54;50;15 - Gale Anderson: Well, our interests are that he purchased it and stuff. He's rather profit is man from the property. And here he is the first. Tell people that I'm the politician talking here. We talk about, We talk about business and stocks and bond. We talk about the livestock. We both got business and family for our garden. It. We got across, or somebody said, how do you manage out there?

02;55;26;13 - Gale Anderson: You are quite a positive person. And he was chairman of the school board, by the way, and he was also a boss. He was my boss, my son. how do you manage? so you know who's going to do what? And I said, well, I said, we are both chief and I don't need a therapist. He doesn't he have to give a fair reply.

02;55;49;15 - Gale Anderson: And and that's the way it is if they're if I have a question and I want to ask him, I ask him and he'll give me his opinion. And, I may or may not take you in the same way if you have questions, I will go after him. He asked me and he will say, here, now we get these numbers, except for you.

02;56;15;12 - Gale Anderson: Think about your dad. No, I'm always glad to give my opinion, but.

02;56;24;27 - Gale Anderson: I just love to, you know. But anyway, that's my the way we work and and encouraging him to write because he is well able to write and he can speak. And I cried and I said, you know, you should write when you encouraging him to write when he said, you know, his father. They were an old family in southern Oregon, and they left in one of the older brothers, and they built the covered bridges in Jacksonville and Jackson County, worked for the countryside over there.

02;57;05;24 - Gale Anderson: All right. Yeah. The highway that was one and a half day was the baby. the average he could write. Well, so I, I just picked up a book for that purpose to go ahead. But I'm always scanning in my travels because I like to travel. But I scanned book stacks and I brought back some from Boise couple.

02;57;32;19 - Gale Anderson: So he's running from a month ago and places to write. you know, with the proper shoes and all. So and I, I said that you plan on writing. There are several practices that everybody that they're built in time. Christ, this beloved character, among other things. I didn't check work, but now I'm glad I could do it, because that time and, practical purpose, to begin writing, what would you be writing about?

02;58;11;21 - Gale Anderson: I am, you know, I have trusted.

02;58;13;11 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: In, in this region, you know, first, we live here only.

02;58;19;01 - Gale Anderson: So the race is still in, is still considered part of the reservation. But I'm interested in history and, like, taking a two credit card from Cheyney and then come from there. And the Native American and I have to prepare a teaching unit. And I'm also working with this Indian family. I think. right. I particularly have to write about how my daughter Sally can animate, like the animated carnival.

02;58;58;10 - Gale Anderson: we had some pets, some wildlife that we've kept for a while. We have this old pet, my mom and I, I just have to start. And more lives on Newman story because he was a very gentle little thing. And I raised him from a baby cap, and he almost died. And I thought, well, this would be interesting for children to read.

02;59;18;09 - Gale Anderson: You know, I, I start out, you know, the baby boomers are very liberal, you know, and then I could tell about how funny grew up in lived the boomers that they travel for all of the boomers children, you know, because of course, that's what our parents are. And then have my daughter illustrate that and then my sister is an artist and she paints Indian a long time ago, she said, why don't you write a little a little story?

02;59;46;20 - Gale Anderson: So I have this book is really by me and I. And so I've decided that I have to write children's books too. But my stories will be young children from and I want to weave that into life history because I. Children's story. If there are any particular intrigues occur in that picture, I know we have. So that was my husband acquired that was a photographer, took probably ten years and we have about 6 or 7.

03;00;22;14 - Gale Anderson: However, my sister abused the number of those for models. Several crazy. Now we just cut a lot books and he was already in our boxes found here. And so I'm trying to write a book about around children's story. In my mind, I wrote this book is about me. No. And I know I feel like I wrote it from a children's primary, the Last Supper.

03;00;50;27 - Gale Anderson: I so our children like, I like on Saturday, you know, I was very privileged. I am a friend of the front line media, but we got busy and everything, but I'm very honest with them, and I did disaster work for them in 1964, before all this confusion, you know, in about. So I'm invited to attend a dedication of my administration building a box of highly honored.

03;01;24;07 - Gale Anderson: And, I asked who I am, the chairman of the tribal council. I told him that I was going to be preparing the year that and ask if I could share with the Tribal Council. I thought I would like to say so. I will. And then another thing I'm going to do is add a foot. So it's so foreign.

03;01;45;24 - Gale Anderson: Otherwise it hardly even make sense about it. But while I was over there, the, one of the ladies, I also along for it and she said, well, guys, I'd like to have you help me. maybe you can go off to talk to her. She said, I spoke to get together 15 or 20 Indian children, youth to learn about government and, I programs.

03;02;15;01 - Gale Anderson: She said we have to get a director. And I said, Lord, we've got to do this work with you as, you know, as a consultant to volunteer because I'm interested in a truth cause like criticism personally, because we are going to involve these Indian children and government and they run with tribal council first. And then my part is, will be, will be, they want to involve the members of county government and then politics so they can see a Democratic caucus, and Republican and Democrat.

03;02;46;27 - Gale Anderson: It all worked out. Let's say that we have our differences, but we still work together. And it's going to be very fascinating. And then showing the song to state legislators in the Congress. And I represent a conflict of county and county from Sam. so we will arrange for sooner or later. But I think in this smart I get the congressional records and better time for them to work.

03;03;16;04 - Gale Anderson: That was the first real fast have been that was the one presidency there. No, I don't think that I really met with president. we've had these children elected to the father because they were in our fourth group and they were several kids. And so six of these children were not the poorest children were not prejudiced. So I'm dollars and and I want you to know, I said, now in the present, this is not look, your children, I said, these children are more than willing, you know, they're not prejudiced, but they these children.

03;04;02;03 - Gale Anderson: But I said, your children have taken care of themselves, because here we've had this big cry from maybe 40 kids around here. And then two of them were sitting over plans. The dog in the corner over in the south. But now they socialized. They took the two years. That was the beginning. But I enjoy India. I yeah, I went to.

03;04;27;26 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: A camp somewhere in the spring and then.

03;04;32;20 - Gale Anderson: The classes we went by and I never saw all these houses like mine. And we ran into people and found me. After his wife served as much on our trip going to get, and we ran into them on the way back and I really picked up a lot of Indian prejudice through them. Quotes. I've heard it in other places.

03;04;56;06 - Gale Anderson: I believe now that some of this prejudice. Might be over the paper in State Park. I don't you see there is the Indians. Well, I'll go back find. One reason I took that course was to understand, realizing that we are sitting here on the traditional Indian ground, that that's what traditional ground here. And the nation was right in here somewhere.

03;05;28;07 - Gale Anderson: And so I thought, well, gee, man, we are getting to. And so when that course came about, I enrolled over and a lot of it was to learn from my from but also, you know, from the south relate to the Indian and, I really don't have any prejudices in the world. I never am, I just them they they're very vulnerable.

03;05;55;24 - Gale Anderson: They're so vulnerable. If they like you, you know, they're so horrible to people. If they trust you. And I think that a lot of the problems. But anyway, so this originally this reservation for 300,000 acres. And it is now down 79,000. And so 200,000 number lots got a lot to learn from them. And they said, well they agreed to it.

03;06;26;07 - Gale Anderson: Well they didn't even know. I really don't think a lot of knew what they were going to do. I don't think they can be held to that saying, well, I agreed to for them being fully aware of what they were agreeing to because then this is all from that program that three. And I did not object at all, to restitution or compensation being given to the Indians.

03;06;55;23 - Gale Anderson: Now, I do not say based on present, they read the state value. But as I sat there that day, their claims are not present. They value the cattle spells. They claimed for 4 million acres of a dollar certain for next year. They in the depth of the crime of to murder. But I can't say I for individual rights unless I put them in my own individual right.

03;07;27;00 - Gale Anderson: They have their rights and this is important. And I tell them that I said, that was from this one lady. I took them, I am interested in their rights, preserving them. But I'm also interested in preserving land because we get to live in preserve. They really do know that to land. But anyway, there's a big controversy as a part of their, land.

03;07;56;21 - Gale Anderson: Missouri, Indian lands. All in here was in your about 600,000 acre paper park was in there. They signed this agreement. I understand the state of Idaho allows the state jurisdiction with the idea that the public recreation, the Indians say, because the only individual houses on the that that they have not kept the agreement. So they are asking for the $600,000 for 600,000 acres of that Hafer Park back from the state of Idaho.

03;08;40;22 - Gale Anderson: And so if that has is prejudiced, it would be mainly based on this. And my attitude on that I don't know what they really is, but the attorney general has said that is I believe he said that in his opinion that, the state had, you know, not lived up to the terms of their agreement and, not only with the Interior Department.

03;09;12;04 - Gale Anderson: Well, I don't feel afraid to discharge them because I feel that really would be agreement. I partner with the state is bound to keep that agreement with the Indians as they look at me. I would hope they would. You know, I'm just to wait and see. But I don't have any prejudice charges because they affect the state of Idaho.

03;09;36;22 - Gale Anderson: You are not following the terms of the agreement. We want that family back or out the family somewhere away. So I don't have any questions. I was I was curious, could you. Well, I feel that you did because you were working with them. But I'm wondering whether we're going to do that. Well, I think of people are feeling threatened.

03;10;02;12 - Gale Anderson: I don't think it's a personal prejudice as much as maybe it might be an economic.

03;10;11;07 - Gale Anderson: prejudice. I don't say that personal prejudice, because the Indians are indeed city.

03;10;20;26 - Gale Anderson: I am well, I don't have that. It threw me off the air with the Tate.

03;10;30;02 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: Well.

03;10;36;01 - Elizabeth Haller-Curtis: They go on. Yeah.

03;10;38;14 - Gale Anderson: Have we about 35 people come? That's the important thing. There's. Well, there's also two questions on here, but the important thing is I say, well, I believe that I know. Yes. I would like to add something. I think that I'm a humanitarian. I'm a humanitarian of a heart for practicality. And that practicality makes me become quite an aggressive defender of my rights.

03;11;11;26 - Gale Anderson: But I don't do the same for other people. Right. And I feel, that,

03;11;21;25 - Gale Anderson: On the basis now, this is my third year as president of the Central Valley Association. I'm there every day. And on the basis of the trans and, the research that I have done, but I, I really I feel personally threatened, I feel we are threatened our way of life, by too much government. And I really, quite aside the federal agency, forever culture.

03;11;59;10 - Gale Anderson: continued professor, perpetuation of federal agencies. I believe that the local unit of government, no matter how lousy it is for the poor, that could be, is still better. And it has to be more responsive than somebody sitting at a desk watching the big thing. And, and I feel I we, we do see our way of life and the it's coming but and I see a trend towards replacing legislative action.

03;12;49;07 - Gale Anderson: Another word action. policies from elected legislators. I see that in danger as being overwhelmed by policies written by what I call the non-elected untouchable. And these are committees, council and commission. Because with so many agencies and of course, this is of greater federal funding than the federal government, but who is the federal government that pays the people?

03;13;31;13 - Gale Anderson: Well, this is the people here. The people are somewhere else. And I do believe that many of these commissions and committees have people on special interests serving on them. And I would just say that more people need to get involved in their politics than all the racket that they could afford, but they're living off, and they should get involved in these commissions and committees and help,

03;14;04;25 - Gale Anderson: Public servants. And that is, I see a big threat to our way of life, if not elected, untouchable.

03;14;16;21 - Gale Anderson: That doesn't. But I think. For many of your actions, I think that many of the things that I do like, break to, are aimed at what?

03;14;34;08 - Gale Anderson: That they're libraries and jewelry and, playground you are providing. And we do. All I see there are where, I don't do and I have that. Idea they get more.

03;14;53;25 - Gale Anderson: Support. I get down here.

03;15;01;14 - Gale Anderson: I don't and I thought for years that this women and guys out in the rural schools should have had their top salaries. The hardest job there is and there are the poorest. Quit working. There you go.

03;15;23;26 - Gale Anderson: No management. They have a the differences between the smaller schools. Oh yeah. Well, the disadvantage is that, there are so many classes and so little time for me to run a course. The thing is, who? These kids learn to work by themselves in the rural school. Yeah, they have to. They learn to study by themselves. They learn to help each other.

03;15;54;15 - Gale Anderson: And this this is kind, because they do learn. And there are other little kids from the kids because you can't help it here. Lots of times when you're in a group like this, this. College thing about this family teaching what they're doing, I mean, they're.

03;16;17;17 - Gale Anderson: Getting big what they got now. But I never was because in obedience, I get a three ring circus camp. Yeah. I just couldn't say that because they say it was bad enough in their own school. When when you have to have when you can only give about 10 or 15 minutes to a class, you can't accomplish that.

03;16;42;05 - Gale Anderson: however, these kids did learn to study. They were on their own. They had to get they were required required to get instruction, papers. They had to complete that. And of course, we checked check them on these, achievement tests. And they seemed to stack up. All right. Sometimes those are even better than the schools. So this is,

03;17;10;02 - Gale Anderson: What did you get? Yeah. Oh, yeah. But is there a difference in the attitude of the people who, after this, children go to rural schools and schools? Well.

03;17;28;16 - Gale Anderson: It's, difficult to say.

03;17;35;19 - Gale Anderson: I come home and the kids are, I think their there is because. Because I don't know, I don't know the kids in school all day anymore. They are in down to which I think is wrong is that those kids can go home, need to get away and go home instead of being there because after all, we babysat or.

03;18;01;12 - Gale Anderson: No, no, no, that's all right. and, But in their own school, I think, I don't know that, because I think most of that about the same there, there weren't, I don't know if they got any more help than the band. they were always interested because they're more interested in their school, because they were so afraid that it was going to be eliminated.

03;18;33;15 - Gale Anderson: And, first, the bigger school you have, the better chance you have. of developing more courses and everything else. But, and had more teachers. But when you had over 30 kids in one school in all eight grades, it's awful. It's terrible. And they learn so. So the people depend on child, right? And they're capable, you know, and any place you after you.

03;19;10;19 - Gale Anderson: Yeah. And they don't have to. They don't have to have they have to have a teacher for, for her. guidance and get them straight and get them on the right track and keep them on the right track. But they can do an awful lot on their own. Even though first graders did. They do a lot of consolidated school for various.

03;19;35;03 - Gale Anderson: Yes. That's where I was. I was glad to have. I have tried Curtis to pick me up from the business. So so I was right. In the midst of reorganizing them, we had to consolidate, and she had the garage. That was the last thing that I did. I didn't get to see it through, but, the guy that I had on set that that all set up.

03;20;01;13 - Gale Anderson: Were you in favor of that happen? Well, yes. Because when you have all these little bitty schools and,

03;20;10;24 - Gale Anderson: And we couldn't afford to post them or to give our county as a board county, all our good land is over on the west side. You see. And we didn't get much timber. And, there's nothing else. The farming is very great. So this is the thing that the school districts report. They couldn't afford a lot of extra things that you would like to have in the school.

03;20;36;09 - Gale Anderson: And,

03;20;39;17 - Gale Anderson: And they couldn't afford to pay more salary. But lots of kids and and they couldn't get back to school. So my children. So it's, I know that it would be much better if they would some property, but they all started taking away, meeting place. This is a lot of my thinking about themselves. Only not the kids that were accounted for first.

03;21;10;12 - Gale Anderson: And.

03;21;14;04 - Gale Anderson: Kids that research center. So what was their state? Did they stay involved with the school or did their involvement decrease or do you know? Well, I don't know. I really don't know because you see is well, as I say, everything was all set up for the final murder. And I believe so I look for them, they they. With them.

03;21;42;03 - Gale Anderson: Anything else you want it. Think so? I can't think of anything. Right. I'm or not here.
