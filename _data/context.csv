It’s time to revisit our narratives from the past, to revise our stories for the future, to re-story a state and its beings whose destiny relies on what kind of storytellers we raise and what kind of ancestors we are going to become. In this interactive session that blends story, poetry, traditional ecological knowledge, science, and history, CMarie Fuhrman, Idaho writer in residence resistance will guide you on a journey of re-storyation.

In this session, participants will be introduced to the “blue humanities,” with particular focus on rivers and literature. There are three main parts: Why Teach Blue Humanities, What to Teach If You Teach Blue Humanities, and How to Teach Blue Humanities. Part one (Why) centers around hope, and the ways that literature fosters hope through “Connecting” (making connections, belonging to the world, participating), “Flowing” (moving connectedly and connectively, changing, adapting), and “Reflecting” (re-viewing, re-seeing, re-thinking). In part two (What), we will explore different ways of using Blue Humanities in the classroom, including examples of semester-long courses (from both scientific and literary perspectives) and shorter units. The final section (How) involves looking at several literary works and thinking about their different approaches to rivers and the concept of “home.”",2023-10-16,Dr. T.S.

context_67,S3E3 The Atlas of Drowned Towns: Recovering the Histories of Places Lost To Dam Construction,"During the twentieth century, hundreds of communities in the American West disappeared, and no one seemed to care. River development projects – massive dams built for irrigation, hydroelectricity, and flood control – displaced or destroyed towns, tribal communities, farmsteads, and ranches on the Snake, Colorado, Columbia, and other rivers. Recovering these lost histories is the mission of The Atlas of Drowned Towns, a multimedia and multi-platform public history project ( drownedtowns.com ). This talk with introduce and explain the objectives and vision of The Atlas of Drowned Towns, exploring some of the questions lurking under the surface of reservoirs: How did these displaced communities respond to their removal – with enthusiasm, acquiescence, or/and resistance? Why did they respond in those ways? What was it like to live in and have to leave these places? And what can we in the 21st century learn from the history of displacement, as we face a future that threatens more such displacement? Bio : Bob H.

context_69,S3E1 Restoring the Wetxuuwíitin’ Collection,"In 1847, Presbyterian missionary Henry Spalding acquired handmade Nez Perce artifacts and sent them from north-central Idaho to his friend and supporter, Dudley Allen, in Ohio in exchange for commodities. This was the fate of many early Native American materials, to be appropriated by non-Natives and removed from the hands and lands that created them. The shirts, dresses, baskets, horse regalia, and more—called the Wetxuuwíitin’ (formerly Spalding-Allen) Collection—would not return to their rightful home until they were purchased by the tribe from the Ohio Historical Society in 1996 for $608,100. On November 23rd, 2021, the Ohio History Connection (formerly the Ohio Historical Society) returned $608,100 to the Nez Perce Tribe. Burt Logan of the OHC stated that if the collection was “in the possession of the Ohio History Connection today, we would freely return these items to their rightful home.” The reclamation of these Nez Perce artifacts is the subject of a new WSU Press book, “Coming Home to Nez Perce Country,” published in June 2021.

context_70,S2E16 The End of the Cold War and American Culture,"The Berlin Wall, Polish Solidarity, Tiananmen Square, the dissolution of the Soviet Union: the end of the Cold War created cultural and political reverberations around the globe. Americans celebrated the United States’ triumph over the Soviet Union, having “won” a conflict that had dominated international affairs for half a century. Yet the end of the Cold War wrought changes in American culture that are sometimes difficult to trace, especially in comparison to the waves of revolution and mass demonstration that characterized other parts of the world between 1989 and 1991. This talk will explore some of the subtle ways that the end of the Cold War influenced American culture, many aspects of which have only become apparent in the three decades since. I contend that the experience of the 1980s and 1990s not only helps us understand American culture in the era since September 11, 2001, but also lends insight into the lasting influence of these decades in American culture today, from pop culture to politics.

Her research focuses on the intersection of American culture and public life and the history of nuclear science and technology. Her first book, Atomic Americans: Citizens in a Nuclear State, will be published with Cornell University Press in early 2022. She also has a forthcoming chapter in Energy Cinema (West Virginia University Press, 2022), which explores how popular entertainment served as public nuclear education in the early Cold War.

The siege and battle of the Alamo is a good way, then, to examine how ethnic, racial, political, economic, and social tensions in the westering of the United States worked themselves out in the face of Mexican and indigenous interests in what was to become the American Southwest.

context_74,"S2E12 Gilles, Giants, and Dragons, Oh My!: The Reinvention of Folkloric Festivals in Belgium","Ritualized festivals in Francophone Belgium (Wallonia) are focal points of civic pride and serve as vehicles for local expressions of historical commemoration. Numerous saint-military marches received UNESCO recognition as examples of “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity” in 2012. The annual processionals involve hundreds of marchers from local communities dressed in Napoleonic-era military uniforms, carrying authentic muskets and escorting a saint statue. Many of these marchers trace family involvement back multiple generations. The small town of Binche became renowned for its Carnival festivities, which included les Gilles – local men dressed in masks with enormous ostrich plume headdresses. In the cities of Mons and Ath, saint processionals transformed into large-scale ritualized celebrations which strayed from their roots as disciplined and formal manifestations of piety into carnivalesque celebrations centering on giant statues, (Ath) and mock combat with a dragon (Mons). These three festivals have also received UNESCO recognition: the Carnival of Binche in 2003 and Le Doudou of Mons and La Ducasse of Ath in 2005. All of these ritualized festivals, which date to the late-medieval and early modern eras, ceased during the French revolutionary regime. Commemoration only revived during the mid-19th century and multiple factors influenced the reconstruction of these festivals. This talk explores the 19th-century reinvention of Wallonian folkloric traditions, their evolution through the 20thcentury, and how these little-known local festivals became the cultural centerpieces of these communities in the present-day.

The Stonewall Inn exists as a private establishment and working bar. Stonewall was a milestone for LGBTQ civil rights that provided momentum for a movement. In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid on the Stonewall Inn provoked a spontaneous act of resistance that earned a place alongside landmarks in American self-determination such as Seneca Falls Convention for women’s rights (1848) and the Selma to Montgomery March for African American voting rights (1965).

The military highway through the South fork of the Coeur d’Alenes opened the territory to prospectors and adventurers. Wallace and the Silver Valley are mining camps, the railroads came because of the money to be earned shipping ore concentrated to the smelters.  The industry has evolved with the changing times, environmental regulations and the communities are ready to continue their sustainability with changes as well. Shauna moved to Wallace in 1980, because the wind does not blow here!  Wallace is the best small mountain town where a person could reside.  It is on the Interstate 90 corridor, near to Spokane, Washington, and Missoula, Montana.   (If one must go to the city.)  It is  in the middle of mountains, rivers, hiking trails and  outdoors sports.

context_102,S1E8 Idaho's Most Controversial Politician: Glen H. Taylor,"Post-World War II Idaho politics were unpredictable, intraparty challenges were common, partisanship, often exemplified by newspaper treatment of candidates, was extreme and anti-Communism, a defining theme of the period, was often an emotional, divisive and decisive issue. The turmoil produced some notable political characters, brought to an end the colorful and controversial career of perhaps the most liberal politician ever elected in Idaho, Democratic Senator Glen Hearst Taylor, and remarkably, particularly considering Idaho’s partisan make-up today, helped launched the unlikely political career of Senator Frank Church. Marc Johnson, a political historian and former chief of staff to Idaho’s longest serving governor, Cecil D. Andrus, speaks about Glen Taylor’s colorful and controversial political career and his influence on Idaho and the nation. Johnson is the author of Political Hell-Raiser: The Life and Times of Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana , published in 2019 by the University of Oklahoma Press. He is a former board member and chair of the Idaho Humanities Council. Johnson’s writing on politics and history have appeared in Montana The Magazine of Western History , The Blue Review , The California Journal of Politics and Policy , the New York Times and many Idaho and regional newspapers. Johnson’s next book – Tuesday Night Massacre: Four Senate Elections and the Radicalization of the Republican Party – is the story of how independent expenditure campaigns began and how those campaigns upend politics beginning with Senate contests in 1980. The University of Oklahoma Press will publish that book in 2021.",2020-07-14,Marc Johnson,David Pettyjohn,Idaho Humanities Council,video/mp4,Image;MovingImage,oral_history,eng,0:58:59,https://anchor.fm/s/8a0924fc/podcast/play/49549197/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2022-2-24%2Fca68cfc3-996e-090c-777f-fa03a92eb0ef.m4a,,https://youtu.be/OpbiqAexDq8,,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/context/small/context_vid_images_63_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/context/thumbs/context_vid_images_63_th.jpg,
