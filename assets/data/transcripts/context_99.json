From there, I interpret articles and poems written by young girls at various Indian schools around the country. I argue that the school girls practice of writing about domesticity laid the groundwork for American Indian women writers to engage the rhetorics of sentimentalism and domesticity that characterize much of the writing about Indians by Euro-American women.",

As Jane Simonton points out, several historians argue that domesticity was an imperial construct used by the white middle class to uphold its power in a diversifying and expansionist nation. Among others, Amy Kaplan and McClintock, Margaret Jacobs, Peggy Pascoe show how domesticity and women's work were indispensable tools for Americanizing the indigenous peoples of the North American landmass we now know as the United States.",

White women lived and worked in and near Indian communities all over the United States, and this work spilled over, not surprisingly, into the curriculum of the federal Indian schools, especially at the boarding schools, to lesser or greater extents.",

Indeed, Richard Pratt and other boarding school officials imagined that the most direct course to saving Indian men was chiefly through their women.",

Perhaps domesticity even held higher priority, for in the housekeeping lesson, reel instructs teachers thus, if there is time for nothing else, housekeeping must be taught.",

    "description": "In this presentation, we'll look at some writings of American Indian women who encountered the colonial, domestic education propagated by federal Indian schools and white women reformers who lived and worked in Indian communities throughout North America. We'll see how these Indian women writers altered the course laid out for them by these reformers and teachers, for in learning to practice the rituals of domesticity they also learned to write about those domestic rituals and sentimental values in syncretic ways. Dr. Amanda Zink is Associate Professor of English at Idaho State University where she teaches courses in ethnicity, indigeneity, sexuality, gender, and intersectionality in literature. Her research and teaching focuses on American literatures from the margins, with particular emphasis on American Indian literature from the late-19th century to the present. Her first monograph came out in 2018 from the University of New Mexico Press and is titled Fictions of Western American Domesticity: Indian, Mexican, and Anglo Women in Print Culture, 1850-1950 . With the support of an IHC Research Grant, she is currently compiling an anthology of literature written by students at the Indian boarding schools in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.",
