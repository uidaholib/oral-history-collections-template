description: "The Context digital collection preserves over 100 recorded conversations with humanities scholars, capturing their research, reflections, and ideas from 2020 to 2024. Originally launched by the Idaho Humanities Council as Connected Conversations during the COVID-19 pandemic, this program evolved into a podcast series that engaged Idahoans with discussions on history, philosophy, literature, politics, and more. Through these recordings, the Idaho Humanities Council provides a lasting resource that explores the human experience, fostering curiosity, dialogue, and deeper understanding of the world around us."
