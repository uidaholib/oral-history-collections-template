00;05;39;27 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Wow. And when they got out 20 miles or would come out because they couldn't make it when they found it. Yeah. They're talking to one of the workers because he was working like a Dickens traveler. And they kept him for about seven years where he was program equipment for trips, back trips. I, I don't know, the different change, the different places he went to.

00;06;06;15 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: and then he finally landed in Virginia when he quit the ship. And he was, you know, the cool man. So that went so well when you went to Omaha.

00;31;42;14 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Neither one got no higher education. I had a little more than I had, but I never I got to the fifth grade that I ever got. And then by the time you went out, start working. Oh, it's working all the time. I just got a few licks in where I work, you know, like school. Connie Kelly was interviewing me or one time, and I happen to have a good schooling.

When you came out, Carol, you have a pretty well all right with the after birth, I can have a funeral. Oh, I'm buried in they they did with at home. I don't see it. Well, I don't know what it looks like, but I don't know what a college looks like.

00;43;21;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah, because I've seen girls, I guess. And you said you'd seen a couple of births or right after births when you were, working it when you present. Right shortly after. Yeah. So it took you. I've been with that with a Reese's. Well, I was just 13. Yeah, when she had her baby. This was the first time I had come to visit me.

00;43;45;16 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: You know. Oh, yeah. In the dark. Oh, okay. Work early morning and get here and rob practice. And then the other day. No, I didn't see that because she had it. Yeah. Miscarriage. And I think we took care of it before I saw anything. But he had to go to the doctor, and I ever couldn't ring, right because I wasn't.

00;44;06;09 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I cried, so I couldn't argue. I scared to death. Sure, I, I didn't know what was going on, you know, I was 14 name and she was probably in and out of consciousness or. No, she was all right. And I just put a pillow under my, put it on my back to my feet or give up, she said.

00;44;23;26 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: So I won't blink so much. And I kept putting these clothes under, you know, and bringing them out water and running from the kitchen to the bedroom and oh God, what a heck of a time I had. Was I glad when the doctor come and he didn't want to time in the winter, you know. And I said, why don't you get in up in that bedroom?

00;44;45;08 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I guess you know when you want. Sure. What? Him. But you wouldn't think of that. No, no, I didn't think of it. Oh, gosh. Remember the two bills that I had anything to do with? Here's this is changing the subject. But I know when we wrote before, all we've got down for skills is cooking. And I know we've got all sorts of skills besides Brett.

00;45;10;20 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, what can you tell me about your skills? What would you say? Well, what would I say? Well, I'm better at my destiny. Like cooking and or catering. You did that for how long? Well, 40 years, 40. You know her? Got it. You know, they used to entertain the homes I've been in. All the big old general, catered, you know, and then I do anything they want me to do.

00;45;42;27 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And the real girls that care won't do nothing but just wait on the table. I cook the meal and serve everything. Did you do the decorations up and everything? Did you do fancy decorating? I don't know if they had any decoration in their favorite setting that they've done that. You know, I had nothing to do with that.

00;46;03;07 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: How about wedding cakes? Would you make those? No, I never knew that. Would you got me a bakery, you know, because I would have to take training on that. Yeah. Decorate. You know, I sent for catalog one time and didn't give me much trouble. Yeah. No problem. I gave that up. So this would be because they make their own cakes, or bakers can make them.

00;46;27;01 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah. I made a wedding cake for. My son mother when she got married in Yakima. But the way I done that, I made the pound cake. that didn't fall. You know, you could make it cold. And sponge cake from cake. And then we put it. We put. Whipped cream in between. And, I love that. And they.

00;46;58;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And then we took it over to Irene Woodward and the cream, and we took it in the creamery, and they covered it all with cream and frozen. Oh, that was the best cake we ever. Oh, these are all the sugar. Yeah, that sugar and shortening that they make the I forget them and the whipped cream. And that made the cake work that song and splitting road and.

00;47;25;07 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: You're you concerned split your own would I want to put that down? Because I'm amazed at that. You probably. You're so used to it. You don't think I'm a skier, but, you know, a lot of times when I'd be in the house, get kind of nervous or something, I just grab them so I would or something like that.

00;47;43;08 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: That just gets me all tuned up and I'm all right. That's me. Yeah. That's good, but, yes. you could work it out. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's right. Yeah. Caring. Or are some of these ribbons here for are they for baking canning stuff. What are your ribbons from the fair for their for. Oh yes from canning and all kinds of canning.

No, I they're mostly from the. Drinking quite a lot. Then whenever you get about half do they. Come on and help you stuff out. I would. That's funny. Yeah. He he was a good guy.

00;48;35;22 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I mean, you don't ever have any Mormons over there. And, you know. There in in this project we're doing, one of the things we're trying to do is, is, you know, talk to women who live mostly in rural areas as opposed to cities. And one of the things we like to ask them is, what do you think?

00;48;59;18 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, what do you think the differences are between being a woman living in a city and being a woman living in a rural area, and what the difference in and the advantages of where there's a lot of difference because you Kansas City women, they think they've got lots to do and they just got the house. Yeah, yeah, but a farm woman, she's got the milk anyway.

00;49;21;10 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: All right. Yeah. They got the milk complete. The chickens and take care of the pigs. Two and here helping the film. Yeah. My mother did. And when, when we farmed, I helped her in the field. Even when you lived here and went out. Yeah. Had to go out. When I was in school, I always had to have some better stay with.

00;49;43;22 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I remember some folks here by the name of Leapers. I get the one little girl, she come stay with her. You know, there's a front thing. She never was afraid to stay here either. The the girl wasn't. Yeah, just like you were the friend when you were little. So that's the way we got mom. And we had to make ends meet, you know?

00;50;03;15 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And I had my chickens out there, I raised turkeys. Oh. Up here. okay, I had I had my cows, I had six cows, and I kind of. Yeah, I was busy. Oh, I guess, and Mr. Cox was working too hard in the field, you know, before harvest would come, I'd take and clean the barn out for him.

00;50;24;03 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: All right. You know, when they done everything reports us, there was lots to do. You had to keep the harness up and you had to cover them horses. Yeah. And everything double up. Looks like a lot. And then all of a sudden, I guess I didn't shift that very tight there. Yeah, well, I'm glad the wind has come up a little bit.

00;50;46;26 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Right. Things. But we have a nice rain here. And you had a nice snow. Yes. So the farmers, I always look out for the farmers. That's what I started doing since I've been here. Well, what when you lived in Lewiston, have you? Since you haven't been farming. There was when he was still living. You work well? There was for six years.

00;51;08;12 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: We took care of the golf course. Mr. Cox built that course. Is that right? Took him a year. Then we moved out there. We got the job caretaker. He was taking care of the house and building and parties and things. So that was your six year. What was that? Okay. 40s. We went out there and 20 600.

00;51;38;07 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: So at that time, you you were more. Do you think you're more of an urban woman than you are? Well, than you were probably so, because I had all I had to do was take care of the parties and things and. Did you like that? Oh, you like it? Did you like more wood? Believe me. And I never thought that golf was a serious game to change that whole round.

00;51;59;05 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And, you know, I got to play golf. Did you mean got in the tournaments? Oh, this is it. I can't play golf anymore. That are more than me. Well, they. Miller took me out one day and I can't do it. I traded for some loose. Yeah, it didn't get back into place. I know it didn't, because I can feel it.

00;52;21;26 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Look, feel out there. Oh, yeah. That in play. That's not like the you know, it's not in the right place. You know I don't know what you can get Reggie Bush I had a good doctor. Does it hurt you anymore. No I never got no answer. I just didn't it either. Oh that's great. Yeah, I think I tripped us up.

00;52;42;24 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Sun's shining pretty bright behind the clouds. Well, what do you what would you say if you could if somebody said, should I live in a city. Should I live in the country? Which I think the gladly would? Yep. Fine. I could have a cow and I could have some chickens and keep busy. Yeah, maybe have a pig because.

00;53;06;05 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Oh, how I love pork. Yeah. Oh, I do too. I don't never but. And I won't pay no dollar for a pork chop. Well that that's way over there. Moist. Yeah a pound do you. Most of your friends are maginn. Are they like you. Do they keep busy or do you have friends that just sit at home and feel sorry?

00;53;28;04 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, I don't know. They're. A lot of my friends are just. Just live in Russian or not here anymore in the years past, you know, and and of course, Mrs. Memory. I'm just a shoemaker. My a really good friend here in the neighborhood who she works in the shop all the time, and. Oh, and Mrs. Miller has that big house.

00;53;47;20 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She takes care of that big house, and they own six houses when they get big. And she does all the painting and cleaning up and everything. Oh, wow. She busy all the time. Well, I've got, but we play pinochle together and have dinners together, which I enjoy. I've got a next door neighbor who I know isn't your age.

00;54;09;29 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She's probably in her early 80s and she doesn't. She's she's had some illness, but she stays in her house. She doesn't have many people come to see her, and she's really lonely when I go over to visit her. What do you think makes a difference in I don't like what you do and I don't know.

00;54;30;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: You know, I might know that if I had gotten an education. Do you regret that? Oh, I regret it. I used to say, Mr. Connors, I say, I don't care what it's going to cost. Irene is going to have an education, and she got it. You got it? Did she go to college? No, she went to business college.

00;54;53;24 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And she didn't even get to finish school. They got her out already. Tried or. Or tried or he would let her go after he got her. He wouldn't. He liked it too. Well, he liked a good work. Ever. Such a good hand. Oh, she's quick and she's smart. You know, when she was little. Just big enough to know anything.

00;55;18;03 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And you get her picture book here. Yeah. And and she sat on my lap and I read to her and just a minute we'd get the dishes. Then mama read to me, and that's all. That girl doesn't always read. Wow. Well, that brings up something else I want to ask you. You know, you mentioned that your dad was was gruff around the kids.

00;55;39;17 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah. And your mom didn't kiss you. And then there was. Then you and I were different. Yeah. You you were. You figure out. My mother used to say. I used to kiss Irene all the time, you know? And my mother used to say, yeah, how can you do that? Well, I just I just love her. I would your mom.

00;55;56;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She didn't think that was appropriate, I guess, you know, I guess she said, you know, I kissed my babies when I was little, but then when another one come that that got to love, then. Yeah. Just waiting for that year that maybe I was a baby. Yeah. Maybe I got kissed. Of course I wouldn't know that. Sure.

00;56;16;13 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I'll never forget the first one I got. Oh, gosh. There was never anything about you on Nicole more. well, and then now you've got your your daughters, and then her daughters have got children. what do you think? There's been a change in in why people have kids or what kids are for, you know, but at your time, there were thing where people got married, no matter how many kids, some had 12.

00;56;46;13 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah. There was a Jacob's family up there around Uniontown. They moved up towards Genesee and they were our neighbors. They had 12. Oh gosh. And you know, food was cheap and they they raised big gardens and everything. It wasn't nothing to raise the kids. But now you raise a child, though, it cost. You're starting with it keeps the cost.

00;57;07;19 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah. And then what do you think? Kids and people don't have the farms. They don't have the cheap food, but then they don't have the work. Well, every kid had to work. Yeah, that's. What's the trouble today with these kids. They ain't got nothing to do, you know, they don't even make make the bed. Yeah. They give them a meal and send them off to school and get them out of the house.

00;57;35;23 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: So there's, been a change. That's a big change. I think everybody should learn a children to do something. That's my system. I don't I don't say that could work out in the feel like I. Yeah, but they learn to do things in the house. So it's in the city. Of course there's another difference too, I guess, that people can decide whether or not they're going to have kids and how many I have.

00;58;00;12 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: They have pills, which I never heard up till it come along. Yeah, I think we talked before, but I'd be afraid. I'd be afraid to take them things. Yeah, I think they are going to cause trouble to the cancer and things. Yeah. Now down I went down and they had a great grandchild. I loved it got fixed.

00;58;22;09 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Why don't the men get fixed? That's a good point. All right? Yeah. Why don't they get fixed? And I'd have the women have let you go through with it. Sure. If you're living, you're going to come on. Well, and that's when the danger is. Yeah. If you work 17 days after your period, you don't need worry. You can't get in the family way.

00;58;42;23 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Is that. Did you have that information when. Yeah. No, I'm just I know from people that I work for I mean yeah. So that's this is the kind of thing it was. Yeah. You don't have to be careful in I imagine a lot of people just quit. Quit sleeping together then. Well, I times or other. Yeah. That's right.

00;59;06;12 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Number of kids or you take the men nowadays. You, you, they wouldn't sleep away from my wife and you know that what I hate over the TV. What's that? All this sex business they talked about all the time? just on every movie or theater program. Now that it's 12:00, it's not for women. Not for women only Barbara Walters.

00;59;29;14 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Right. And they kill the whole thing there, right on the TV. Yeah. Then a man has got to have his deal every 24 hours. Is that, Yeah. There was a barber here, and nice looking. Barbara was married. He lived across from the store here where Mr. Worthington had a store. This is how I found this out. She told Mr. Worthington that he had to come home at noon for lunch.

00;59;59;03 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: You have to be in there. He couldn't wait tonight. he must work that poor woman to death. Yeah, I think so. oh. And maybe. Maybe she felt the same way. That that'd be okay. But if she didn't, you go in and take her home. How's that? What do they call him? Yeah, and then he's. If you got a dog, you're going to take cash, right?

01;00;25;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Never. He's going to be bumming around. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I don't be that man, though. I see something I give you that I didn't get the. Oh, no, that was. Well, let me see. What else do I want to ask you? Oh, I want to ask about the depression. What did that what kind of an effect did that have?

01;00;47;00 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, you and your family. Well, I can hear that. We found it more than this one. That first one that was in the 30s wasn't, you know, 29, 30. I can't it we was at the country club at the time. So I and you know that so many other people, they were just taking their money out of the bank.

01;01;12;10 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And I never made an effort to do that because I thought if it goes broke, it goes broke. What happened? And I had my money in the First National Bank. Actually, I kept mine. Shepherd. Did you? Yeah, I kept my my new shepherd. How did you decide that? Was that just something you. Well, yes. Because then I didn't have to ask him all the time for a check or something like that.

01;01;34;16 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And I had done my own. I said, if I want to get me a dress, it's my own money. Yeah. So. And the American bank, I didn't have any in there, but I got I got checks from the boys. I did pay me. We had a dinner or something. You know, where the American bank. So every time I'd get American bank check, I had to go to the bank with it.

01;02;00;23 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And that bank opened in three days. And the other one didn't know for three months. Oh, God. So, you see, if I hadn't done that, I wouldn't. I had no money to run. and when the three months was up, I, I didn't do it. No, no money in that as a bank. I got it all. Oh, so it worked out all right with me.

01;02;20;11 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, know that when you were talking about you kept your money separate. That brought something else to mind that I want to ask you. What do you do? You notice a lot of difference between you and your women friends that are married? do you think you're more independent? They're more. I am when I had had my own money, I think.

01;02;39;20 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah, yeah. Do you think you would have done as much, be so active now if you were still married? Well, I don't know. I think I've just kept on. And if he lived, I kept on just like I was doing catering. Yeah. When did you decide not to do that anymore? When they wouldn't have me anymore. Oh, old.

01;03;06;14 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: They just say no. I don't care what happened to me. Is it Mrs. Skillings? Every lady that I help all the time. she had a dinner partner for the doctors, and, I don't know, I went around this back five years ago. I guess it must be about five years ago. And I had a hemorrhage or the nose.

01;03;31;15 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Oh, we're just going to start doing a bit late having the dinner. They were drinking, you know, it didn't. They didn't. We were supposed to eat at 8:00 and they didn't get ready for ten. Oh, I had to keep that food out. Oh, that's got some. Didn't get out and Miss Kevin come out. You judge. We're fine. We're going to eat, she says.

01;03;52;26 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I grabbed a plate and was put on a plate, and I felt my nose rip and I grabbed it with a towel I had there, and I ran outdoors and I thought it was dark, but I thought that was me going back out. I got to running and just ran, and she sent one of the doctors out to see you.

01;04;16;17 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, that was lucky, I guess. Yeah, the real doctors there. And Doctor Stein, do you know him? And he come out and he. Brother, he ran back in and got a bath towel and by golly, we showed that. No, I let it run on the ground. and friend, they got me in the house and put me on the bed and so.

01;04;38;23 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And my stomach got for the plan. Oh, really? It was going down the back. It was going down in my stomach. And they were trying to make an impression. I oh, well broke my teeth to pressure my lips to make. You know, and I said, that won't work. I said, just full. And so right there, let me get up.

01;04;59;04 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I went outdoors and he went with me because I got his car out and took me out the hospital. And when I got out there, my mouth was full. I just got a hold of it and just come a big role. Come on. All over my stomach. A blood. Oh, my. Oh, yeah, just like I. Somebody's been killed there.

01;05;19;08 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And, And the emergency hospital couldn't take care of me, so they had to call from there to call doctor Ward. No, he's an ear doctor. And he. We went over to the hospital and, not to hospital on fifth Street where the cop office is. And he came down right away, and he burned it. Cauterized, I see.

01;05;43;27 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah. That's it. I quit bleeding then, but I had another one then. Oh, about ten days after that and he done the same thing and then I've never had it again. So that was quite an experience. And so they got afraid to have me I see. Yeah. Uncover that hemorrhage. So what what did you do then. You didn't work.

01;06;09;23 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: That was after the cook's job at the high school. Yes. So when I was working, was it hard? Was it hard not to have work to do after I quit the school job, I didn't know what to do in my show. The catering was enough.

01;06;27;19 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: But I never went to the school job again because it just about killed me off there. Were you. Were you depressed about not having enough to do? Did you feel bad? Yeah, I got to keep busy. Yeah, I've just got to keep busy. I couldn't croak, I used to crochet a lot, but that didn't interest me. Yeah, that's like that little thing that's crocheted in there, but.

01;06;51;04 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: You ought to crochet those. no, I had one of them. Okay, well, let's see, what about World War two? How did that affect you and your family? Oh, I can't tell you everything I tell you. I got your story, and a lot of others come in here. Did you think everybody did? Well, you did have some, up on the coast to Washington, wasn't there some?

01;07;15;19 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I mean, it was that close there. Yeah, a couple of. Well, I mean, you know, got scared cuz you can mama, we're liable to come over Live Nation. Yeah. He was scared of it. I'll never forget that morning after Pearl Harbor. I don't know where Mr. Cox was working. He'd gone to work that morning and it was foggy that next morning.

01;07;38;24 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And you? That and I, I saw forms standing in the door. There was a like a policeman. It was a policeman. Drew forgot what he did. What he come for. It scared the heck out of me. I think it was just in ten minutes. I wonder about which one I wore, you know. Oh, it just scared me.

01;08;02;01 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah, but he come to ask directions for where somebody lived or something, and he had to call, but it just scared me. And. Oh, we were so afraid for a while. Yeah, that was something, wasn't it? Oh, yeah. You know, even the trains that have all the coaches with a change down and for blackout. Yeah. Real blackout.

01;08;26;24 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: After something. I would ask you also about what do you think about, about marriage. Do you think it's on its way out or do you, do you think that it's still a good institution? What do you think? Well, you know, that's the way it is. You know, we you were made to be together. And I think that every they should get married because a man raped too many years otherwise.

01;08;54;24 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah. You think so? They've got to have it. They've got to have a woman. You got. You don't think that's the same for women? Women don't have the same. Well, yes. There is some women that can't get enough. I know I have a friend that she's just sick when she can't have. Is that right? Is she? What age is she while she's getting along?

01;09;15;29 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She was born in 1917, so she's 50, some 60, I don't know, just now, the last few years since her mother died, I know nothing about her. She goes to Seattle? No, but if she is like she was then where she was married. You married an old man, and then she married that and get married against a guy that was stronger than she was.

01;09;41;24 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She had to quit him. Oh, is that right? Like there was a bar, Brush Canyon. Yeah. and then she used to have the guys come to share their. But they couldn't get upstairs. She she didn't know what was going on. Yeah. Kind of an invalid. So she's got to have it. So there is women as well as men.

01;10;07;13 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: But you think the institution of marriage is a good institution? I think so. It, I think it saves a lot of girls. Young girls. Well, how about, what do you think about that? Have you heard about the women's movement of liberation? You know, I don't know much about it. I don't read anymore. I just read my morning paper and read all of it at that.

01;10;31;20 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: So, I don't know. I can't talk on that because I don't know nothing about it. It sounds to me like you've never been. You've been a liberated woman. Well, first goal was, I. I tried to live a clean, decent life. Oh, I wish I. I think it's so neat that you have your parties and your friends keep seeing, and I just I just always have a good time at whatever I do or wherever I go.

01;11;03;22 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: And I go for fun, I have fun. How about you? you don't seem like you worry about much. Have you worried? Do you spend a lot of time? Oh, I do worry sometimes. I especially now with my daughter. I worry about her a lot, too. Yes, yes, it just worries me. Because when I don't hear from them, I always think there's something going wrong.

01;11;27;17 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: You know? It's something to worry about when you know that she can't make water anymore. That's something. Oh, is that right? Oh, yeah. On a machine. Kidney dialysis, I see. I don't think I understand. Just two weeks ago I tried two weeks ago to see that I'm going to grow into your arm. Yeah. And drink blood. Quit going to do so.

01;11;53;29 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She had to have that taken out or redone. So you see that upset her and you. So where did you think, hey, I was a nurse, you know, that runs the machine. My chest. They take you to treatment three times a week. And that machine, when it peeps, there's something wrong. Oh, I see, and even the nurse didn't know what trouble.

01;12;21;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: That's what it was. The blood wasn't going through. And so, you see, it takes somebody to run that. Yeah, she could probably learn to run it, but she said I wouldn't take a chance because I wouldn't know what that meant. Yeah, yeah. So even that nurse didn't know what it meant. Oh gosh. I suppose you never had. They had happened before too.

01;12;48;22 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Young fellow. She's got a family, wife, two children. I don't know which way he lives, but not too far from my dreams.

01;12;59;12 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I'm getting making you talk so much. You're both probably dry. What get you into crawfish? I'm. I think I better put my sweater on. Oh, well. I guess. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That makes me laugh. Oh, that picture I know. I think that's one of the best ones I've seen. That one. Yeah. I want to just ask you one more thing in that list.

01;13;26;11 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Do you have any advice that you'd that you would give them a woman say that was moving to a rural area that had been maybe from a big city? How would you what would you tell her? What if what could I tell her? What if she was apprehensive about moving to a small place and she didn't know if she'd fit in and where she might not.

01;13;53;03 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Of course. That depends on the woman. Do you know? I wouldn't know what to say, because it just depends on the person. Some wouldn't be fit to move out. and the same way that farm woman move into town, you'd be lost. You think? Yeah. Yeah. She and I think we the same as a woman moving out.

01;14;15;28 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: She'd miss on her, activity in town. Well, I don't know what else to say. Well, that's okay, and then maybe just. But is there anything you want to say about your life? Do you say it's been happy for the most part, or unhappy or. Well, I don't know. I've been unhappy very many times and real happy at times.

01;14;38;00 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: We wish you were happy when we used to go to dances. Oh, yeah, I think that, gosh, I wish I would rather dance to the eight I do anything. Do you get to go to a dance? When I worked out, we danced all night to 4:00. Go on. Go. Go for the man. Stay up all day and night and get the next night.

01;14;57;05 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah, yeah, I've done it many times. We went in there ten miles out. Yeah. And you used to be a fairy up here with the is where we come. I came in the wagon. Did not the buggy and go to the dance across the house, across the. And when the when the when it was out at 4:00, we danced for 4:00.

01;15;24;11 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Then we'd start for home. Well, we'd be home right after daylight. Walk in the morning and in the fall, like, you know, that was a long trip. I know one time it rained and all was muddy, and, it was terrible cover over the well. Oh, gosh. Well, we should fix for it. And heavy coat, piano and. But then was it good old days?

01;15;50;15 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I always say them with the good old days, which they were. Yeah. So, yeah, I had a good time after I left home. And how about after your husband died? Did you please. Where am I going to that then? I didn't have a partner. I never wanted to go anywhere. But I would never marry again because I never get another man like,

01;16;12;27 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: So I'd never try another man. I guess you had to make some adjustments. Oh, just a lot of adjustments so many times or something. You know, a man, wife have secrets or some things to talk about, you know. And I'd have some to tell him. And I couldn't tell him because it wasn't here. Yeah, I missed that more than anything.

01;16;35;29 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Well, I guess that's why I've got to ask. You know, just, Thank you for lunch. That was so good. You're welcome. And, I'll be thinking of you Friday at your party. I picked a good time. Read at noon. How long do they usually stay? Well, we played bingo, then talked for. Usually 4:00. It'll be a little later because it's more daylight.

01;16;59;10 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: Yeah, I want to get in spring. You know, they probably stayed or for 30. Oh. How many of there be? Probably maybe about 12. Oh one times 14. You ought to call the newspaper. I think we're back home. I have a lover. Well, yeah. Okay. This is nothing. Her daughter just came over to see me. Oh, they said you've got to have that in the paper, so they didn't want to take that up.

01;17;24;19 - Cathy Naugle or Ida Mae Cox: I'm going to go keep my picture. But I like the people at the center. Take a copy of it.
