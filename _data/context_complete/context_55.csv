So, all three of you, when we were talking earlier, the with the three of you, we talked about one of the, one of the things that has changed most in Idaho journalism. And the conversation tonight is the changing face of of the media in Idaho. One of the things that's changed the most in recent years is the conditions under which you work, safety, hostility, attitudes toward the press.",
Bill Manny,[00:04:07:07],00:04:33:15,"And, let's start with Clint. But this weekend we saw some of that playing out in your town where, you had this you had this clash between, conservatives, like, right wing groups who came to town, to protest, the pride parade. And you've seen some of this hostility now in your coverage has been a backlash against law enforcement in your community.",
Bill Manny,[00:04:33:19],00:04:48:22,"So maybe you could walk our viewers through kind of what you've seen happen this weekend, what's happening in your community and and how your staff has dealt with some of these very issues. Were discussing.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:04:48:24],00:05:17:19,"Well, I appreciate that. And thank you for having us this evening. Yeah, this this last weekend was, an interesting time in North Idaho. And, you know, I think looking at it from our point of view and, and our newsroom and, all of the employees are first and foremost priority, of course, is safety. And making sure that our team is, is taken care of in the field and, here in the office all the time, it seems to be more an issue.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:05:17:19],00:05:51:08,"as tensions rise around a lot of these social issues that the some that you just named and others. And it kind of clashes internally, too, with our role as a leader in breaking news, our leader in being, you know, as accurate as possible, as as balanced and unbiased as possible. And I, a weekend like this last one, it really put us in a position of it's better to be last to post and be accurate than it is to be first and incorrect.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:05:51:10],00:06:17:17,"And I think that is something really important for all of us to, to look at really closely as we take, you know, more and more, guff for being fake news and, you know, you know, inaccurate, statements and, and whatever we may, we may be putting out there. So this, this weekend, we, you know, we had some indication that things were, getting a little warm around these events.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:06:17:19],00:06:53:22,"And we went into it consciously thinking, you know, we we need to be very careful about what we publish. We need to be very careful about, the photos that we, allow on our social media, making sure that we are as as balanced as we can be, you know, frankly, from the this bystander's point of view, maybe, it was a day like many others, here in town, the event that everybody I'm, I'm sure familiar with, occurred and was pretty contained in a, in a fairly small area.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:06:53:24],00:07:15:10,"I think it's important to note, that, you know, the people involved, most of them all but two, in fact, of the 31, were not even from Idaho. And, and that's, I think, something now we're dealing with even more where the tensions are rising and it's a global universal tension, maybe around an issue. You know, we're all on a global stage.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:07:15:10],00:08:00:23,"And I think that no matter what's happening, we need to anticipate that there'll be participation in, whatever, whatever that event may be, whether it's virtual or in person, by, by readers and, and those with opinions all over the country and even internationally. You know, this event made international news. And I'm really proud of our journalists and our newsroom, the steps they took to be as careful as they could be, navigating this to make sure that it was, not only safe, for, for our staff, but the, the general public, in addition to, not overplaying any of these things so that we, you know, looked like it",
Clint Schroeder,[00:08:00:23],00:08:28:07,"was a sensational, event, you know, for, for this to now come back on law enforcement and some of the individuals, especially, the chief of police and the county sheriff, you know, this it's just disheartening. They did such a phenomenal job, making sure that everything was by the book and you know, done. They acted quickly, swiftly, and it it couldn't have gone better.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:08:28:07],00:08:53:16,"I think, from, from my point of view, however, you know, it's just it's hard now, this doxing thing is, as I'm sure you're all familiar with, where your personal information, your address, phone number, those kinds of things may end up, in a place you don't want them to fear is, you know, a human emotion and and every, you know, bullies like fear, you know, that's that's that's where we're at.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:08:53:16],00:09:17:05,"And, you know, this this pulls us to the the whole noble job that we have protecting the First Amendment and making sure that, you know, I protect your right to say whatever it is you want to say, even when I don't agree with it, as long as it doesn't incite violence. And and that's a that area of gray maybe getting wider and wider.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:09:17:16],00:09:22:07,"And that's, that's sort of how I feel about what's what what happened this weekend.",
Bill Manny,[00:09:22:09],00:09:32:16,"Or did your staff face any, direct threats themselves, or is it been at this point directed toward law enforcement?",
Clint Schroeder,[00:09:32:18],00:09:57:22,"There have been a few members of our team that have had, some doxing things happen. We've had we've had a number of things in the past, kind of coming from, you know, the the same type of tension and the same edge of this bell curve. The personal threats this time were more general. You know, so I, I feel like we, you know, we navigated this well enough.",
Bill Manny,[00:09:57:24],00:10:25:12,"Okay. Christina, I know that, one of the things you and your staff have been wrestling with in the past few years is safety and threats. You know, in your reporting. And, you have to go into decision making on assignments and staffing, keeping the safety of your staff, in the forefront. Right. Talk about how you work through that decision making.",
Christina Lords,[00:10:25:14],00:10:42:16,"Yeah. I think, when I first started as a journalist, people would always, kind of look at me and say, oh my gosh, that's unusual, and ask, you know, what stories I was covering or what my beat was, those sort of things. And now when people ask what I do and I say I'm a journalist, it's inevitably negative response.",
Christina Lords,[00:10:42:16],00:11:14:13,"It's, you know, how do you feel about fake news? That's these sort of things. And on the surface, it can seem very, you know, surface level. It can seem not that big of a deal. But when we do, controversial stories, a good example is one that we worked with, with some of our partners at, Boise State Public Radio on, the Ammon Bundy situation in Saint Luke's downtown, where, Ammon and his supporters encouraged the shut down of the hospital in downtown Boise.",boise
Christina Lords,[00:11:15:19],00:11:37:20,"And we we and we recognized that they were doxing public officials. The judge in that case, law enforcement in that case, the social workers in that case, and we were we were genuinely worried that, these reporters would also have their personal information and their addresses, posted online. And we had, at least for our reporter.",
Christina Lords,[00:11:38:06],00:12:03:11,"You know, we talked about, do we need to get a hotel for you to stay in at night so that you feel safe with you and your family? She has a young daughter. You know, these are all things that, play into our decision making when we're when we're doing stories. I would say it has a chilling effect on a lot of people because they're just more uncomfortable with taking on really hard issues without knowing who's going to read this and where they're going to post your information about it.",
Christina Lords,[00:12:03:11],00:12:32:19,"I think that's especially true for women, that are in this field. I think and I'm not here to say that men don't get threats and vile, vile things in their inbox as well, but, it's just, you know, about a month ago, one of our reporters got an email with, the C-word just laden through it, you know, and she kind of laughed it off because, this is not unusual for her at this point, but it is unconscionable.",
Christina Lords,[00:12:32:21],00:12:51:14,"And it is insane that we can't, talk to each other. And if you do have genuine questions about the reporting or the, its direction, we're happy to answer those things. But the rhetoric and, and, and that sort of thing does play into the stories that we go after and how we frame them and what our plan is after they're published.",cinema
Bill Manny,[00:12:51:16],00:13:16:08,"Boy, there's lots of, lots of right material there for discussion. But let's go to Don and ask, have you noticed in the time you've been publishing Boise Dev, a change in the in the culture, the way your news is, is, you know, the reaction to what you do? And have you had, either threats or hostility aimed at at your folks?",literature;boise
Bill Manny,[00:13:16:08],00:13:28:12,"You have that you have a niche publication. You are doing less kind of broad national and political coverage and more local political coverage, Don. So what what have you noticed, along these lines?",
Don Day,[00:13:28:14],00:13:54:21,"Yeah, I would say that our, our focus is a little bit different. We're at, or in large part, staying out of the kind of hot button social issues. But these things really intersect with everything. And, you know, two years ago, during the kind of the first Covid summer when when fear was high, case counts turned out were low, and people were trying to figure out what to do.",
Don Day,[00:13:54:22],00:14:24:06,"There was a lot of consternation. And, our offices here downtown, and we cover the city council here in Boise very, very closely. And, there was a just a strange confluence of events where we had, people protesting at Boise City Hall on the night that the city's budget was going to be approved. And, you had, sort of loose right wing groups and loose left wing groups both showing up.",boise
Don Day,[00:14:24:06],00:14:48:01,"And Ammon Bundy had threatened to show up. And, you know, the whole kind of local media, ecosystem kind of banded together that night. And I remember, at the time, my, our head, our Boise City Hall reporter, Margaret Carmel, and at the time, she worked for the Idaho Press. And, we have a partnership with the Idaho Press, and this is before I hired her.",environment;boise
Don Day,[00:14:48:01],00:15:07:20,"So a little bit of context there. But their plan was for her to watch the meeting from home and, we also work with with Channel Six here in town, and their news director at the time, Jay Bates, was going to be, in person. And I felt it was really important that day to be, in the room at the meeting.",
Don Day,[00:15:08:04],00:15:32:16,"This is the budget. This is where the city lays out its priorities for the coming year. And, you know, it was during Covid, so masking was happening and a lot of distancing. And, being at the City Council chambers that day was was wild because there were, gosh, probably 30 or 40 cops just in the lobby of, City Hall, not to mention all the the folks that were outside and people in the chambers.",
Don Day,[00:15:32:21],00:15:46:17,"And I remember was the first time I ever thought to myself, I need to think about where I'm going to sit today. And, and, you know, it used to be I would sit, you know, in the second row, first row's too much. So I'd sit in the second row at city council meetings, with my back to the door.",
Don Day,[00:15:46:17],00:16:08:03,"And that day I was like, yeah, I'm going to sit where I can see the door. And that's not something I had thought of really before then. And I think it's changed for a lot of people. You know, I have a staff of five, and, we're, plus an intern, so we're always thinking about what are we going to cover, how are we going to cover, what's our approach?",
Don Day,[00:16:08:05],00:16:32:18,"What are the plans for people to be safe? Because it's it's a dynamic situation. And I think it's important to say it's not just journalism. It's as you as as we talked about, it's law enforcement, it's politicians. It's been a lot of focus on the instance, the Supreme Court, in DC this summer and, and the homes of those officials.",
Don Day,[00:16:33:24],00:16:53:16,"Officials on both sides of the political aisle and in Idaho have been had protests at their home from people on both sides of the spectrum. Right. We had left wing protesters protesting city council people at their home, right wing protesters protesting, Idaho, members of the legislature. And so it's a very dynamic and volatile time. And I think there's a lot of professions.",
Don Day,[00:16:54:02],00:17:01:11,"Saint Luke's Hospital, for crying out loud. They shut down a hospital. They're now thinking about this. That never really did before.",
Bill Manny,[00:17:01:13],00:17:37:12,"I think a lot of us who went into journalism viewed it as a public service. Like, like politicians, like law enforcement, like hospital workers. And I think finding ourselves being called enemies of the people is kind of a surprise and a and kind of a discouraging place to be. Christina, when, you know, and when when Clint was talking about how they covered, you know, events in Coeur d'Alene and talked about, you know, picking stories and photos and, you know, bending over backwards to be balanced and so talk a little bit, how do you how do you how do you cover a controversial issue?",
Bill Manny,[00:17:37:12],00:17:50:11,"How do you be tough? How do you hold the public officials accountable. And yet not inflame, a situation and, you know, make it worse? How do you approach that?",
Christina Lords,[00:17:50:13],00:18:16:20,"I think, my, editing style and, and leadership style is really to try to get and build consensus within my team. I just don't ever feel like me making a decision, by myself is ever a smart move, especially when it comes to controversial topics or stories. We when we when we go about a controversial story, you know, it's it starts at the very beginning of story planning.",literature
Christina Lords,[00:18:16:20],00:18:36:24,"What are our photos going to be? Who are we going to talk to? How can we represent each of the sides? Well, what do we do? And this is happening more and more recently as well. When some of these public officials refuse to talk to us. There are legislators and, county and city government folks that refuse to talk to any single reporter at this point.",
Christina Lords,[00:18:37:13],00:19:07:12,"And it's very, very difficult to tell both or all sides of a story when folks refuse to speak with you. So that's a challenge. How do we we, as a, as a staff, don't have a photographer, so how can we get something that is going to illustrate this story fairly? It's hard with things like abortion debates and police shootings and things like that, to have one photo as your main thing, when there's a lot of different conversations going on and different viewpoints that are represented.",
Christina Lords,[00:19:07:12],00:19:26:03,"So. So if I have a protest sign of, you know, pro-life, stance, I try to within the next, you know, a few paragraphs in the, in the body of the story, try to represent the other side. There are things that we do that I don't know, that the public really sees that we're trying to get to.",
Christina Lords,[00:19:26:03],00:19:46:08,"They're trying to represent the sides. But then I think when we talk about things like white supremacy, are there two sides to that story? How do we how do we tell people what's going on in these communities without giving a megaphone to literal Nazis? You know, it is something that we have to talk about as a staff. Who do we quote?",
Christina Lords,[00:19:46:08],00:20:03:06,"How do we quote them? How do we I think they're I see people on Twitter all the time that wish we could use more forceful language when we're talking about some of these issues. But there's like a lot to deal with. If you call someone a Nazi and they're not a Nazi, they can sue you for those things.",
Christina Lords,[00:20:03:11],00:20:28:04,"So we have to be very, very specific and careful with the words that we use. You know, and how we describe things. Obviously, in this country, people are not, guilty of a crime until they've been convicted of those things. So we have to take those things into account, even when it's obvious, even when it's obvious that and, you know, an 18 year old went into a Texas school shooter at a school and was a shooter and killed 19 people, 19 kids.",education
Christina Lords,[00:20:28:04],00:20:49:04,"You know, it's just we have to be careful with those kind of things. And I think sometimes the public gets frustrated with what they feel like is us not being aggressive enough. And some of those points, I always just feel like if we've made everyone on all sides equally mad, we're probably done, done it right, because you can't make anybody happy in this industry.",
Christina Lords,[00:20:49:04],00:21:00:09,"And so I feel like if we're getting feedback from, conservatives and liberal folks, then, then it usually indicates that we're, we've hit somewhere the sweet spot in the middle.",
Bill Manny,[00:21:00:11],00:21:24:10,"I, you know, I think most people don't appreciate the nuance that goes into even what seems like really easy decision making, covering a story, headline, photo placement, those are all nuances you weigh with every story. And I and I know that the public doesn't understand that even when we screw up, we in the media screw up. We don't set out to screw up.",
Bill Manny,[00:21:24:14],00:21:49:18,"Right? We have systems in place where we are trying to get these things right. And Clint, you know, we talked a little bit before about how these kind of stories can give Idaho, North Idaho, other parts of Idaho a black eye. So how do you and you've dealt with, issues of white supremacy and racism and, those kind of stories in North Idaho?",
Bill Manny,[00:21:49:18],00:22:03:07,"How do you balance, how do you balance the nuance in covering them completely and thoroughly and aggressively and, and and also wondering about the way you're going to portray your community and your state.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:22:03:09],00:22:37:22,"You know, that's a it's a great question. I think it's one that we struggle with, more often than we'd like, you know, North Idaho, Idaho in general. Isn't, as we may be portrayed in, in the media, you know, and I should say in, in the larger scope media, as, as we look at as I just said, you know, as I look at, especially this last weekend, you know, this this was of international interest and, you know, it's just kind of been one of those, recurring themes.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:22:37:24],00:23:19:09,"And I think every place has its challenges. I think every place has its issues. You know, 21 years ago, this area of the country got a lot of attention, for that specific, topic. But I think those of us that live here, and especially people that are from here and take a lot of pride in in North Idaho and and being an Idaho resident in general, you know, really are working overtime to make sure that that's not the only message that gets out there and really struggling with that message to, you know, making sure that we are all on the same page with how we describe and talk about this area.",labor
Clint Schroeder,[00:23:19:22],00:23:44:23,"You know, 98% of the time, because we need to build the confidence and we need to build the knowledge that that other 2%, you know, people, people know better. I will say, as far as trying to be as balanced as possible, reporting this, reporting the facts, and getting off the topic when it's just not necessary to continue to report on it, is probably our best policy.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:23:44:23],00:24:13:18,"And the reason for that, I believe, is anyone who has a distinct interest in whatever that topic may be, is going to find it in another on another, you know, venue, another avenue of, of of media. And as we discussed last week when we talked, more and more of those are popping up every day. And, you know, they're, they're getting to, the niche that is very interested in the extreme.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:24:13:20],00:24:40:12,"And I feel like there's so much of that now, that for us to do our job as a community watchdog, you know, bringing micro local news and information to, readers, the community, making sure we keep the business community healthy, making sure that we provide, a voice, that that truly is, as balanced as possible, you know, has got to be job number one.",
Don Day,[00:24:40:14],00:24:42:24,"Bill, can I add something to what Clint saying there?",
Bill Manny,[00:24:43:10],00:24:44:05,Sure. Yeah.,
Don Day,[00:24:44:07],00:25:06:18,"I was, I was I had one of the national cable outlets on behind me today, and they were talking about the events up in Coeur d'Alene. And I mean, literally, you had people and the whole thing, they didn't they didn't know how to say it. And, you know, and then they strung together there was a couple of incidents down here in Boise that were entirely unrelated, within the last couple of weeks.",boise
Don Day,[00:25:06:18],00:25:23:00,"And they strung it all together, and it was like, like an Idaho. Well, somebody who's never been here and lives in New York and is used to things being very close together on that side of the map. They aren't all the same. And one of the things that has been interesting in the last few years is this kind of nationalization of of media.",
Don Day,[00:25:23:00],00:25:43:16,"And we, leading up to the election, I know Christina paid. That's probably the closest attention decided to this, which was there was this cottage industry of national news publications writing about Idaho's politics. And there was one story that ran that said, you know, I know it's going to be a purple state in a few years. It's kind of laughed at that one, I don't know.",
Don Day,[00:25:43:17],00:26:06:19,"Well, that's going to be the case. And then another story that that basically the premise that came out the day, you know, Idaho is going to be a white ethnic ethno state. I was like, I don't know if that's going to be the case either. Right. But it's it's it's easy for national outlets to kind of parachute in, maybe not even send somebody here, talk about things, roll it all up and be like, look at Idaho, look at the freak show.",
Don Day,[00:26:06:21],00:26:35:02,"And that is why I believe really strongly in in what, what we're doing in these local communities. Because that local information you're not going to get from MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, The New York Times, Washington Post, etc., etc., etc. you're not gonna get that. And in fact, the panel discussion that I was watching up or listening to on the cable channel today, I would bet in large part was predicated on the fact that Clint's journalists were digging up in his town.",
Don Day,[00:26:35:17],00:27:00:04,"And, and that's how this works. We're here to do the work in the local communities to find the facts, to help people have that context. We have an ad for one of our reporters, Margaret, and it says, what they said, what they did, why it matters. And and that's what we do here so that people can understand what's happening in their community.",
Don Day,[00:27:00:04],00:27:23:05,"They have to have a common set of facts. And there are some what I call pink slime sites out there, primarily on the right side of the spectrum, but also on the left that look like news, kind of talk like news a little bit. But our our opinion in disguise. And we're seeing more of that and it, it makes it harder and harder for all of us to have a common set of facts.",
Bill Manny,[00:27:23:07],00:27:48:17,"You know, when, we did when I was back in the States, when we used to keep a running tally of all the national publications that would do these big stories about, Idaho. And the lead was invariably Idaho. It's more than potatoes. And and then you see that over and over and over again. But, you know, sticking on that theme, maybe I'll start with you, Don, and go to Christina and Clint.",literature
Bill Manny,[00:27:48:19],00:28:28:01,"You know, it's not just that, we have people come to town and misrepresent Idaho. Idaho journalists end up dealing with attitudes toward national media. So so you may or may not ever report about abortion, but people who are angry about a polarized national, media and, and reporting are angry at journalists in general. So, we here in the state have to deal with an attitude toward journalists and media that maybe not of our making.",
Bill Manny,[00:28:28:01],00:28:30:04,Is that what you found Don?,
Don Day,[00:28:30:06],00:28:49:15,"Yeah, I know we in our kind of set up conversation, one of the things I said that I think a lot about is. The industry, the media industry deserves some of the scorn. And I and I think it's really important to not say like, we're innocent. We're just doing our best, and we are just doing our best.",
Don Day,[00:28:49:15],00:29:14:04,"Right? But the media landscape has changed really dramatically in the last couple of decades. And, there are national pulling pieces of data that shows the general public doesn't even really know or understand. And, you know, a couple weeks ago, I, I'm not sure which cable channel it was, but there was a clip that was like, you know, these, these rich journalists.",
Don Day,[00:29:14:06],00:29:23:14,"And it was funny because I follow a lot of journalists on social media, and they were all like, do you want to see my bank account? Like, that's right. Like we're not elites. We're all they're all just.",
Christina Lords,[00:29:23:17],00:29:28:17,Go look at a parking lot and a news at a news station or a newspaper and look at the cars.,
Don Day,[00:29:28:22],00:29:56:09,"It's true, it's true if the newspaper has a parking lot. Right, right. So a I think it's important to not not say that the media is perfect. The journalists are perfect because there's and they're not. And lots of mistakes have been made in the last few decades. You know, I worked at a traditional, news outlet for, for 17 years here in town, and I left because I was tired of big corporate media in large part.",
Don Day,[00:29:56:11],00:30:17:22,"And that's kind of the thing, right? It's it's it's it's big and corporate. What's interesting about this discussion is all three of us are locally controlled, right? Christina is the decider for Seattle Capital San. I'm the decider for Boise Dev and Clint is the decider for Portland Press. But tell you what the decider for most of the traditional outlets isn't necessarily even here.",boise
Don Day,[00:30:17:22],00:30:36:00,"They're owned by companies in DC and in California. And and that changes that dynamic. And that's why you see, if you watch your evening newscast, you see things that don't really anything to do with Idaho, or you pick up your newspaper and you see things that are like, well, what's this, you know. Right. What's this wire service telling me?",
Don Day,[00:30:36:02],00:30:55:07,"And so I think it's all kind of tied together that the media landscape is shifted. It means a change in how the news is produced. It means that there have been some, I think, black eyes for the media. And at the at the end of the day, I think a lot of us are trying to course correct and recenter on on the audience.",
Bill Manny,[00:30:55:09],00:31:31:06,"I'm going to go to Christina, but I just want to remind our, audience that if they have a question for one of our panelists, they can drop it in the Q&A. Q hit the button at the bottom of your zoom screen, and you can shoot that question to me here. So, Christina, you have experienced both, independent nonprofit now and having worked for, for, a big national company, how do you kind of view the that relationship and what we in Idaho a deal with.",
Bill Manny,[00:31:31:08],00:31:35:04,"Well, that's a big that's a big sigh. That's a big sigh. Christina. Yeah.",
Christina Lords,[00:31:35:04],00:32:02:23,"I, I have worked at newspapers, small and large. I have worked for companies small and large. And I will say that my most positive experiences have been at family owned newspapers or, in this new nonprofit world that I'm living in, I feel incredibly less beholden to, goals set by folks that are not that have set foot, maybe in our newsrooms, maybe once, once or twice, you know, those sort of things.",
Christina Lords,[00:32:04:00],00:32:29:12,"It's it's extremely hard to make story decisions when you have smaller and smaller staffs, which is something that I hope we talk a little bit about that just the the newsrooms themselves have changed over the last 20 years. There's far fewer of us doing this work. That were 20 years ago and things like that. And so at some point you do have to make very interesting, very hard decisions about what you dedicate your resources to.",
Christina Lords,[00:32:29:14],00:32:53:05,"And in a corporate sort of environment, those ideas are much different than perhaps what I do at the idle capital sudden now, where we do write up little briefs on how you can testify, with it about electric charging, stations for vehicles where you can show up to, how you can show up to a public hearing if you're interested in what your health district is doing with masks, those sort of things.",environment
Christina Lords,[00:32:53:10],00:33:14:19,"Whereas those things in a big corporate, environment, they're not going to have the splashy and sexiest headline. So we don't do them anymore. And it's very, very difficult to make those, those decisions when you're dealing with, people who skew younger in our newsrooms, who have less experience that they, are looking for their story of the day.",environment
Christina Lords,[00:33:14:19],00:33:31:06,"And if they get a press release, they can just rewrite it and that's it. We don't have, experienced 20 or 30 year, 40 year veterans in our newsrooms anymore. And it hampers, the content that comes out of them. So, I felt like I was kind of rambling on that one. But,",
Bill Manny,[00:33:31:08],00:33:54:01,"When you raise some really good points that, I hope, we can, do a deep dive into and just in just a minute. And Clint, any any thoughts about kind of how how we and Idaho deal with attitudes that are often generated by cable TV and national news media that may or may not have anything to do with the work you and your staff are doing.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:33:54:03],00:34:23:24,"But I think a lot of this comes back to sometimes opinion, and we may be touching on this down the road. Should I? I'll just save it because I like, you know, I think that's that's something that we, we definitely should, should spend some time on. But I would have to agree with Christina that the expertise, on the, our journalists, journalism teams, I think is sometimes to our benefit because they look at things with a fresh eye.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:34:24:12],00:34:51:03,"But to our detriment, when we do have mistakes made, we don't have the, you know, the, the beat and source relationships that, you know, those experienced, you know, long, long time journalists have, in many of our communities and fostering relationships internally so that these journalists want to stay with us and continue to grow because we know we're all a training ground for the next big thing, especially when we've got we've got the, the, the new guys right out of school.",labor;education
Clint Schroeder,[00:34:51:03],00:35:01:24,"So I would agree, I think that that doesn't help us, when it comes to dealing with that attitude. And that's where I feel like when we jump into the opinion piece, I think this is very related.",
Bill Manny,[00:35:02:01],00:35:25:16,"So, lots to talk about. I wanted to just touch on something that Christina mentioned before, and then we'll move on. But Clint and Dawn, do you have are you running into people who will no longer talk to reporters? I mean, that's got to be that's got to be a pretty a pretty dark day when you're trying to tell all the sides of a story and some of those sides aren't talking anymore.",
Bill Manny,[00:35:25:19],00:35:29:08,"Clint. And then Don, have you run into that?",
Clint Schroeder,[00:35:29:10],00:35:45:04,"You know, I can't think of anything specific off the top of my head. I we have definitely run into people who want to balance record. So they're they're recording the same conversation so that they can repeat it. Especially.",
Clint Schroeder,[00:35:45:09],00:35:46:06,To.,
Clint Schroeder,[00:35:46:08],00:36:06:21,"Our journalists. You know, sometimes don't have those relationships and they're not really sure who they're talking to and how that's that's going to play out. You know, I guess in my opinion, we're we're seeing a lot more of the double check. We're seeing a lot more of the skepticism on will you report this, you know, through a balanced lens, or are you gonna put a spin on it as it goes?",
Clint Schroeder,[00:36:06:21],00:36:20:09,"And people don't understand the difference between, you know, the sensational reporter and a journalist who, you know, main objective is to remain unbiased as, you know, as often as possible.",
Bill Manny,[00:36:20:11],00:36:37:16,"Well, and as Don pointed out, not all journalists, you know, deserve credibility and trust. And so you have to spend the time on the beat to earn it and get to for people to get to know you. And we often aren't in that situation anymore with our staffs. Don, are you are people are people not talking?",
Don Day,[00:36:37:18],00:36:46:02,"You know, I would say not not for the reasons we're discussing here. I'm almost never, somebody who won't talk because they want to talk about what we're asking about. And so there's that.",
Bill Manny,[00:36:46:02],00:36:52:20,"But but when you're asking for sometimes for proprietary information about development, about markets, about about business plans.",
Don Day,[00:36:52:20],00:37:27:15,"Yeah. I mean, people often are like everything the thing we run into the most people we write a think about things that people don't want us to write about a lot. Yeah. And it's not even Earth shattering things. I will tell you a story that I think is on this this topic, though, we had a story that we did a few web about about six weeks ago, and a, person quoted in the story, who's, who's an elected official went on their Facebook page with the link and said I was horribly misquoted by Boise Devin in.",boise
Don Day,[00:37:27:17],00:37:49:03,"And so, I was alerted to this by someone else, and I hopped in there and, and went in the comments and said, hey, I take that really seriously. Engage with them, took them at their face value and the individual. I also, message to the individual and they, they, couldn't say at the at that exact moment what was wrong, which is the first red flag.",
Don Day,[00:37:49:05],00:38:07:06,"And I said, well, you know, my reporter on this, recorded the conversation and I was going to say, I said, you know, it's funny because one of your peers has told me in the past, this reporter, could they not quote me quite so precisely? Could they take out the SOS and ums? And I was like, fair point.",
Don Day,[00:38:07:08],00:38:28:09,"And the person who'd complained on Facebook when I was being recorded and I went, yep. And in fact, you can hear you acknowledging that at the very beginning of the recording. And they said, I didn't know that. And I was like, well, you did, because I can hear it on the tape and all of a sudden the complaints about the problems of the story went away.",
Don Day,[00:38:28:09],00:38:48:17,"There was one like minor kind of really minor thing that I think was a misinterpretation. And they said, well, I'm going to follow up with you with all my other complaints. And it's been six weeks and I've heard and so, you know, yeah, I think you will have people sometimes, and they said they wouldn't talk to us in the future and out like, well, I don't really want to quote you again in the future anyway, because this is what you're going to do to us.",
Don Day,[00:38:49:07],00:38:56:22,"And so, yeah, I think it's possible, but for the most part, we haven't had a lot of trouble with that, just yet. But it could be coming.",
Bill Manny,[00:38:56:24],00:39:22:19,"Well, I think we're seeing we're seeing some of that. People have decided it's they cannot talk to the press and then claim that their side's not being reflected. And as we saw statewide, we had fewer and fewer Idaho politicians want to participate in debates. So that's another place where they're choosing to not to communicate in a setting where that was really traditional before.",
Bill Manny,[00:39:22:21],00:39:48:07,"So what the changing face of media. Christina, let's go to you. You know, you talked about, younger staffs, less experienced staffs, less, less, you know, fewer reporters with graying, their beard. And how is that affecting the stories you do and the kind of work you do? And, and the kind of nuance and sophistication you want to see in, in your reporting.",
Christina Lords,[00:39:48:09],00:40:05:03,"Yeah. It looks like we have a question in here about what is known. What is the nonprofit newspaper. So my answer that really fast. Okay. It asks where we get our income source. So, the I don't capital son is a part of a national consortium, under the nonprofit umbrella of an organization called State's Newsroom.",economy
Christina Lords,[00:40:05:05],00:40:23:13,"And we rely solely on donations and grant funding to, to pay for our reporters, and our, in our reporting. So it's all donation based, grant based, those sort of things. There's a lot of really exciting, examples of community funded journalism that are starting to spring up, that we can talk more about if we have time.",education
Christina Lords,[00:40:23:13],00:40:25:12,But that's kind of the basics. Well.,
Bill Manny,[00:40:25:13],00:40:44:23,"And then there's also now there's nonprofit, or foundation reporting going to some for profit media. So you might have you might have a newspaper company that's getting, additional reporting staff from some of these nonprofit, institutions that want to see reporting beefed up.",
Christina Lords,[00:40:45:00],00:40:49:14,"Right, exactly. Okay. Could you rephrase your first question again, I forgot.",
Bill Manny,[00:40:49:15],00:41:12:18,"So we're just talking you kind of introduced this notion of of the evolving, the living nature, the nature of staff. And, you know, we talk about experience and youth, which is can be good and bad. But, I think you were talking about, you know, nuance, sophistic open source development. So how do how are you kind of wrestling with those issues in your newsroom?",environment
Christina Lords,[00:41:12:20],00:41:39:18,"Yeah. I would say that it affects the Idaho Capital Sun a lot less than some of the other newsrooms that I've been in, because all of our reporters have been in Idaho for, if they're not from here, they've been in here for a, you know, 15 years and have been reporting here. So what we see in the industry is, you know, that, your annual income, your annual wages are not keeping up with what people need to survive, like many other industries.",economy
Christina Lords,[00:41:40:12],00:42:03:12,"People, you know, I made $10 an hour for most of my reporting career. It led to a lot of credit card debt that I am officially, finally out of. But these are real things that reporters face. To do this job. I, I went into editing. I applied for the assistant editing position at, at the Idaho Press because I could no longer afford to be a reporter.",economy;literature
Christina Lords,[00:42:04:01],00:42:31:10,"I didn't have the experience that I thought I needed to be able to help other people in their writing. But I did it simply because I needed the money. And so when that's happening in newsroom after newsroom, nationwide, statewide, we just have a less experienced media corps out there covering things we don't understand. I tell young reporters all the time, that the city council and what they're discussing didn't just pop up the day that you walked into City Hall.",
Christina Lords,[00:42:31:15],00:42:52:12,"There's literally hundreds of years behind you that you've got to figure out to figure out, like, how the heck you got to hear how we're still talking about some of this stuff for 20 years. I just assigned a story today to a reporter that I worked at at the Moscow Pullman Daily News and, 2009, and that stretch of highway still has been built.",moscow
Christina Lords,[00:42:52:14],00:43:26:18,"But knowing that, knowing that history and knowing that it's the environmental impact study that has tripped that project up for years. Meanwhile, there's fatalities all over the place on that stretch of highway. How can we offer those pieces of context? If you yourself don't know them, you don't know what you don't know. And so when we have very young people in these newsrooms who don't have mentors that have been doing this for 40 years, it's harder and harder to put together cohesive, contextual, in-depth, data focused stories because you just don't know the back story.",education
Christina Lords,[00:43:28:02],00:43:53:10,"We see a lot of people leave the industry for things like PR jobs and stuff like that because it pays better. Benefits are abysmal in the newspaper industry. McClatchy, which owns the Idaho Statesman, just barely, started offering parental leave. These are sort of the things that, in normal industries, you kind of assume are there. And we write about parental leave for other industries all the time, but do we have it ourselves?",
Christina Lords,[00:43:53:19],00:44:18:24,"You know, these are things, I think, especially after the pandemic, where people are looking for better jobs, better quality of life, sort of things. And, and we're losing people to better paying, jobs. And, and people just cycle out of newsrooms. A lot of times, the only way to get a promotion in a newsroom is to go somewhere else is to physically move you, yourself, and your family to a different state to start there because you can't get a raise where you are.",economy

Don Day,[00:52:43:18],00:53:09:19,"And the pandemic happened. And I'll tell you that year my goal was to hire a person. And I didn't even know it was possible. And I hired three that year. And then I heard another one the next year. And it turned out that our mics are kind of our I wouldn't probably name it Boise Dev if I had it to do over again, because it's not just Boise and it's not just development, but people want to know what was happening in their neighborhood.",boise;culture
Bill Manny,[00:53:10:22],00:53:14:06,And that was a moment when Boise was exploding.,boise
Don Day,[00:53:14:12],00:53:34:20,"Yeah. And honestly, so much like just before it really took off. And the things that we're talking about, I didn't foresee there was this moment and, and there was a kind of a snarky journalist on Twitter, and they didn't even mention me. And I happened to see it, and they said something like, I always don going to write about the Wendy's opening.",
Don Day,[00:53:34:22],00:53:52:05,"I saw that, and I remember being like, well, that's not cool. And I've never been bothered by it. Like, oh, I'm not doing I'm not doing this important work. But what it turns out is that, you know, I did a story yesterday about a new McDonald's and star. And you know what the most read read story on our website is today.",
Don Day,[00:53:52:07],00:54:06:06,"It's the new McDonald's and star. And that was a light bulb to me to say, you know what? I've been in this industry a long time. I came out of and I'm not denigrating my former employer at all, but it came out of a place because it's really common where the approach was, we are the journalists, we are trained.",labor
Don Day,[00:54:06:06],00:54:23:01,"We're going to tell you what's important. And I've tried to flip that around. We we ran we did some billboards a couple of years ago and they said local news, locally owned. We put readers first. And it's my belief that that is where we have to go as an industry. We have to put our readers at the center.",
Don Day,[00:54:23:01],00:54:44:23,"We have to answer their questions. We have to give them what they are wanting to know about. And we do a lot of stories around here that don't do a lot of traffic that aren't the McDonald's and Star, but my reporters, we talk about generally what's popular, but there's no quota. I greenlight stories all the time that in my head I go, that's not going to get a lot of reads.",
Don Day,[00:54:45:00],00:55:07:08,But there's an interesting it's almost an inverse relationship between stories that convert to members for us or people who are willing to to pay for our premium service and popularity. It's this fascinating thing where stories that don't get a ton of reads convert and turn people into paying customers and so we try and balance those things and do journalism that is important.,
Don Day,[00:55:07:13],00:55:13:12,"That may not always be super popular, but also do journalism that's popular and isn't always important.",
Bill Manny,[00:55:13:14],00:55:34:24,"So I want to ask Christina kind of the same story. And then we'll go to Clint as well. But Don, you you started with, you know, plant pads and growth and development, but you've focused in on general city government and even city politics. Why did you add, you know, add expand into that.",
Don Day,[00:55:35:01],00:55:57:00,"All these things, one market opportunity, I saw that there was a gap in coverage in this market of development. First, there wasn't any or there was a little bit, but it was, and really not and even what was there was very blithe. And so I saw that gap. The gap is we've got a lot of competition now.",
Don Day,[00:55:57:02],00:56:15:16,"We're not the only ones that cover development anymore. But then all these things started to happen around it in Boise, the big contentious issues of like 2018, 2019 were we're going to build a stadium, are we going to build a library? Are we going to build a trolley downtown? So I was like, well, we need to start covering the city council and the mayor, because that's where those things happened.",boise;education
Don Day,[00:56:15:18],00:56:36:02,"So that kind of glommed on because that was development. And then it was like, well, we need to probably do some business coverage because that's related and startups. And so we started to kind of do all these things. And and so now for us it's development, growth, civic business. Last year, about a year ago we launched a product called Idaho First.",
Don Day,[00:56:36:04],00:57:03:03,"It's a morning newsletter that comes out every day. And it is designed to give people kind of everything they need to know for the day. And we hired Gretchen Parsons, and she writes what we call it. We internally call ABC, and it's kind of the three most interesting, important stories of the day that she writes gives you the best of us, but it also gives links out to good stuff from the capital side or the statesman or Channel two or channel seven, and events.",
Don Day,[00:57:03:03],00:57:22:00,"And then we put a pet of the day in there. That's the most popular thing we've, I've done in my entire career. And so we've now tiptoed into like, we're really trying to give you a holistic look at the market, which isn't where we started, but it's all focused on what the reader wants. And I've talked too much, so I'm going to let Christina go.",
Bill Manny,[00:57:22:02],00:57:33:01,"So Christina, you see a different but similar story. You started, you you stood the capital sign up from scratch. So talked about talk about how you did that.",
Christina Lords,[00:57:34:08],00:57:43:22,"I don't think it would have happened if I didn't have a very kind of abrupt speed bump in my career. I was fired. And so, googling the.",
Bill Manny,[00:57:43:22],00:57:44:22,Administration.,
Christina Lords,[00:57:44:24],00:57:52:12,"From the Idaho Statesman, I was fired from the Idaho Statesman. And I really, genuinely thought, like, okay, here's my sign. You know, you see.",
Christina Lords,[00:57:52:16],00:57:58:12,"Why you should say why? Because I think people should know why, that it wasn't, like, bad.",
Christina Lords,[00:57:58:14],00:58:26:12,"I didn't do anything illegal or harm anyone in any kind of way, so that's good. I did tweet about how, our newsroom was, struggling to get access to basic, office equipment like, the Microsoft suite, including Excel, which the reporter needed, to, download and interpret, census data. And so I generally thought, like, I've been really stressed out, with journalism for a long time.",
Christina Lords,[00:58:26:12],00:58:41:00,"Maybe this is my, my sign to go do something else with my life. Go be the librarian that my mom told me to be. And and that's what I thought I was doing. I was looking at master's programs to go get my master. I thought, okay, here we go. And Twitter was also the thing that got me my new job.",
Christina Lords,[00:58:41:00],00:59:00:13,"So I, I went to this journalism conference in college and met this girl, and she connected me with state's newsroom. And the thing that was most interesting about that was she just, my boss just let me talk. She just let me say what Idaho needed. What I was frustrated with in the Idaho journalism landscape. What do Idahoans need to know about that they're not getting?",
Christina Lords,[00:59:00:15],00:59:29:17,"And I just had a lot of ideas about that. I've covered state and local politics almost exclusively, exclusively my whole career. And really, genuinely do believe that lawmakers and voters make better decisions when they have factual information at their fingertips. And so we can't know what we're voting on if we don't have reporters putting stories together on how these things come to be, who's paying who to make these decisions, all of that sort of stuff.",
Christina Lords,[00:59:29:19],00:59:50:01,"And so, so my boss basically said, I think you have more journalism in you, even though you think you don't, you know, and it was like, I don't know. And so I went off to the mountains for the weekend, and I walked around and tried to, get my feet under me. And, and I thought, there is stuff, and I don't want to be a journalist anywhere else.",environment
Christina Lords,[00:59:50:01],01:00:13:17,"I don't want to go work for the New York Times or for the, you know, Houston Chronicle or little tiny papers elsewhere. I want to be a journalist in Idaho. I care about this place. I care about telling these stories, not somebody else's. And so, so I started kind of asking around to the folks that I thought, if I could build a dream team, I can do this, you know?",
Christina Lords,[01:00:13:17],01:00:32:14,"And I really, genuinely did get to do that. I got to build a team that is very experienced, that I knew that I worked well with, and that we could really do some, some interesting journalism. And then it's basically telling our story and saying we do have a different funding model than other folks. We don't have a paywall.",
Christina Lords,[01:00:32:14],01:01:04:09,"We don't have a traditional subscription that you sign up for. You know, and it really is hoping that we put enough good work out there that people see it, people notice it, people see that it's, I think, exceptional. I think very well done. And can offer a lot to other folks. The other thing that's really cool about our product that I'm really proud of is that we allow, any other news outlet to pick up our work with proper credit, and it's because, I have worked at the Moscow Pullman Daily News.",moscow
Christina Lords,[01:01:04:09],01:01:22:11,"I have worked at the Idaho Press. I have worked at the Idaho Falls newspaper, where we have our budget meetings, and we talk about the stories for the day, and inevitably, something is left behind. There is never enough of us or enough reporters to get to the stories of the day and it breaks my heart. It kept me up at night at the statesman.",
Christina Lords,[01:01:22:17],01:01:43:08,"It kept me up at night at the Idaho Press. So if we can help. There used to be every newspaper used to send a statehouse reporter to Boise to cover the legislative session. That does not happen anymore. How can we be, You know, how can taxpayers know what's going on and how their money is being used if no one is there watching this stuff every day?",boise
Christina Lords,[01:01:43:11],01:02:04:00,"And you do and like John says, you do have to be there every day. You have to sit through the city council meetings. You have to sit through all the hearings at the legislature to know what the heck is going on. And to put that in context. And it helps when you've got like the Clark Corbin's of the world, who's on our staff, who has literally done that every session for more than a decade.",
Christina Lords,[01:02:04:02],01:02:27:07,"And he can remember he can Clark can predict whatever is going to happen inevitably, like he just knows because he has been watching it for long enough, and he knows the sources well enough to know how the votes are going to go and things like that. So, that's the quick and dirty on the Idaho Capital Senate. I'm really proud of what we do, and I'm really grateful to the newspapers that see the value in our work and pick up our stuff.",
Bill Manny,[01:02:27:09],01:02:42:04,"So, Christina, quickly, how big is your staff now and is is your funding, is it year to year? Is it five years? Is it ten years? How long do you have to prove to prove it a success? How does that how will that work?",
Christina Lords,[01:02:42:06],01:02:59:07,"None of my bosses have ever put a cap on it. So they told me to get a two year lease for our office. I felt like that was a good sign. You know, I actively have conversations more on one on one levels. You know, sometimes we'll do call outs for donations and things like just reminders of it does take human beings to do this.",
Christina Lords,[01:02:59:07],01:03:26:16,"And it isn't just slapping a press release on Facebook, so everybody can see it. There's work that goes into what we do. And so I'm genuinely hopeful that we'll be around for a long time. State's newsroom is expanding. It has a plan to be in all 50 states in some capacity by 2025. Idaho was the 21st, state newsroom, and we're I think we're up to 27.",
Christina Lords,[01:03:27:01],01:03:35:24,"And we're onboarding, reporters and editors for places like Arkansas, Indiana, and we just launched in Alaska, those sort of sort of things, and decided about where we are.",
Bill Manny,[01:03:36:01],01:03:37:11,Size of your staff is.,
Christina Lords,[01:03:37:11],01:03:58:00,"Yes. So there's one editor, me and three, full time reporters. And then we also added our first intern, the summer. So I'm really genuinely excited about that. And Idaho Capital Sun was also selected for the new Boces, Internship of Idaho, which places Latino students in, in newsrooms to make sure that we're addressing Latino issues in our reporting.",
Bill Manny,[01:03:58:02],01:04:16:24,"Good. Thank you. So, Clint, you know how you're a more traditional media, how do you view these the startups that, are they competition or are they augmenting, Idaho journalism? Are they a threat to you? How do you view, startups like Christina's and Dan's?",
Clint Schroeder,[01:04:17:01],01:04:17:24,"Well, you know, I.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:04:17:24],01:04:47:08,"Think it depends on what startup it is. And as we look at, as we look at, you know, our partnerships here on, on the panel today, I think there are ways that, you know, done. Christine and I can work together very, very productively. You know, I, I think gone are the days where our journalism, particularly well done journalism is absolutely, proprietary, our own.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:04:47:10],01:05:11:16,"I feel like if we can partner and build stronger and stronger products independently, especially those of us whose maybe markets don't touch. You know, as far as the advertising dollars goes, you know, those. That's usually where it gets a little iffy. But, you know, I, I really feel like quality journalism, quality content. We should be partnering because I may have something you're interested in.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:05:11:19],01:05:35:24,"You're doing something that maybe we don't do or don't do as well. Just like capital coverage, you know, having a partnership with the statesman, you know, it's it's been great for us. I don't have to have a capital, assignment. And, you know, there's the we we don't really use a whole lot of content, outside of, when we're in legislatures in session, you know, it's still valuable content.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:05:36:01],01:05:55:03,"And, you know, as I look at, you know, like, Boise dove and and we, we look at, capital sudden news, I think there's, there's really more we can be doing. And it goes further than that. I think this goes further than our core products. Maybe this complements some of our niche products, some of the things that we do annually, whatever those, those, those may be.",boise
Clint Schroeder,[01:05:55:05],01:06:26:10,"So I, I don't feel there's, the journalism competition, with, with quality well done, content. Now, I think where it does, get a little dicey is, the edge of the spectrum. Right? And people are, you know, these, these these products or online mostly, now online products, they seem to pull eyeballs and readership because people only want to read what they 100% agree with.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:06:26:12],01:06:47:15,"And and unfortunately, in a traditional media, that's not necessarily our content every day. You know, depending on, you know, what the issue may be, but, you know, quarterly press, for example, you know, it's a 130 year history at this point. My, my time with this paper, even if I'm here for 30 years, you know, it's just a drop in the bucket.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:06:47:15],01:07:10:15,"I'm just a steward of this organization for a while, and it's my job to lead it better than I found it. And I think navigating, a time like we're in right now, it's it's really it's it's imperative that we meet the reader where the reader wants to be, and we bring the reader, a different level of content that they can't find anywhere else.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:07:10:17],01:07:30:18,"That micro local news and information that isn't necessarily opinion pieces or is it necessarily skewed one way or the other? We're telling the reader what to think. I think it's more about, gosh, look at what a great place we live in, or this is what's happening politically, or growth infrastructure. You know, those are the things that we do such a great job.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:07:31:01],01:07:52:07,"Putting together. And I think that if we stay on mission, then our core tangible products, I think our digital edition, our website, our apps, you know, all the niche products that we put out and even the newsletters that go daily, you know, I think they become as valuable, to the reader as they've ever been.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:07:52:09],01:08:21:09,"You know, I think we talked, when we prepped for this call last week. Our our readership right now is the the eyeballs are the numbers are higher than they've ever been. You know, we're engaging people at a much different level now. Sometimes the core tangible product, might not show that in, in a physical number. But if we measure our audience more in a more sophisticated way, and we reach to our audience in a more sophisticated way, they engage with us differently.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:08:21:21],01:08:36:16,"And our reader, you know, as, as we discussed before, isn't just in our backyard anymore. You know, people that have moved away, they care about the community. They can they can follow every day without having to wait three days for the mail to deliver it. You know, things like that.",
Bill Manny,[01:08:36:18],01:08:56:01,"So I want to, I want to I want to talk about opinion and the way it's influenced both, both the business and news reporting. But we have a couple questions from viewers that I'd like to, try to get through quickly. So the first one is, in a digital reality that is littered with misinformation and social media trolls.",
Bill Manny,[01:08:56:03],01:09:21:04,"How do media institutions deal with online? Com comments and moderation? And what is the line between free speech, public opinion and harassment? So, we just we just, why don't we go with you, Clint, and then Don and then Christina. Why? And you don't all have to answer if the person ahead of you says it, you can just give them a thumbs up or a nod and say, great answer.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:09:21:06],01:09:41:19,"All right. I think this is a great question. I feel like, gosh, it is our job. At some point if we're going to have digital assets, because that's usually where that's going to show up, right? If we have digital assets, we have to moderate what's there. And I don't mean censor what's there. And I don't mean delete comments unnecessarily because we don't agree with them.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:09:41:21],01:10:12:07,"We have to make sure that people hiding behind the screen and keyboard aren't bullying everyone else for their comment, or their their take on the situation. Personally, I feel like our website, isn't a place for comments. We we do, you know, funnel our comments to our posted stories on social media. Well, there it is. You know, the social media animal, right there is, you know, you're bound to run into some problems.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:10:12:09],01:10:32:14,"It's a big concern. Because you can't keep up, especially with, you know, a big story of, like, this last weekend, for example, by the time I read the post on social media, which, had 793 comments and about, I don't know, 2 or 300 shares by the time I got to it. It's we can't catch up.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:10:32:20],01:10:56:21,"So having somebody you know, if you're going to post it, it's your story. And we want to put the breaking news up or the really important stuff up in social because it does reach a bigger audience. We need to make sure that we're taking care of our readers. And that's that's I don't want people to come to our site and feel like they're, you know, going to be called a really awful name or, or bullied to the point where they're afraid, that happens.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:10:56:23],01:11:21:10,"And I feel like it is our responsibility. Just like with letters to the editor that we make sure that, you know, as best we can that we, you know, cite or research, you know, any facts that may not seem like they're correct. And, you know, talk to the submitter to make sure that, you know, they understand, we'd like to make sure that we verify.",education
Clint Schroeder,[01:11:21:11],01:11:45:09,"But in addition to I don't like to in fact, we we won't publish anything that, you know, is just clearly inciting a violent action or calling names or is is just misinformation. Because I think that makes us responsible. You know, one of the things kind of about that is, you know, letters to the editor are tough. You know, we have that we have a right, you know, we're we're walking a fine line right there.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:11:45:09],01:12:08:10,"And I don't want to censor and edit people, but I also don't want to put us in a bad position, which we've been in before, where people think that it's our content when taken out of context and shared virally, suddenly in the digital world. And all of a sudden I have people on my team that are, you know, maybe taking a death threat or we have a bomb threat, you know, things like that.",conflict
Clint Schroeder,[01:12:08:11],01:12:09:11,It happens.,
Don Day,[01:12:09:11],01:12:29:03,"So I'll just I'll just say simply, we don't have comments on our website. I've kind of had a career long, hatred of those, I think. Bill. Bill knows, we do have a Facebook group and we moderate it pretty strongly. We and we have rules that are really simple. No promotion, no attacks on others, no speculation or false info.",economy
Don Day,[01:12:29:13],01:12:54:14,"And that framework has worked pretty well for us. We're not afraid to delete comments when they break those rules, remove members when they break those rules. And the most powerful tool on Facebook is to just shut the comments off. In fact, when we were covering mask mandates last year, we just instituted a blanket policy that if we had a story about masks, we posted to Facebook and shut the comments off and and I would say the reason was what new is there to say at this point.",
Don Day,[01:12:54:16],01:12:56:24,And people went along with that.,
Bill Manny,[01:12:57:01],01:13:06:00,"On, if you start applying new, what's new to say about that? On, on, every story on social media, it might shut social media down.",
Don Day,[01:13:06:02],01:13:08:15,Yeah.,
Christina Lords,[01:13:08:22],01:13:33:03,"I kind of take a different approach. I don't look at the comments once. I don't look at them at all. I don't care, like I genuinely no good can come from that space. It's not good for my mental health, I don't. We have rules that are baked into the back of the Facebook about profanity and certain terms, that if you use them automatically, your comment is hidden.",
Christina Lords,[01:13:34:06],01:13:52:24,"We don't have comments on our website. If you really have a genuine question about our reporting or something like that, my email is publicly available and you can find it there, and I'll, I'll answer it in a workspace, but I don't I don't read the comments because I think it's the most vile place on the internet, and I, I can't stomach what I see there.",
Christina Lords,[01:13:53:13],01:14:01:15,"I don't think it's a positive place to, to reflect myself for our reporting.",
Bill Manny,[01:14:01:17],01:14:24:03,"From, from our Humanities Council board member, Kenton Byrd, who is, a journalism professor. He shared this question for all three panelists. Thanks for your commitment to local news of your reporting in the past year. What story or series are you most proud of? And on the flip side, what's the big one that got away or didn't get the coverage it deserved?",
Bill Manny,[01:14:24:08],01:14:30:11,"So why don't we start with you, Christina? Big story most proud of. And the one that got away.",
Christina Lords,[01:14:30:13],01:14:48:14,"There's a lot of a lot of work that I'm really proud of. But I think toward the end of last year and the beginning of the legislative session, we ran a series about how our foster care system is completely overrun and underequipped, to be able to handle, the folks that are seeking, care through the foster system.",
Christina Lords,[01:14:48:24],01:15:09:21,"Our reporting led to, a jack the budget Committee in the legislature, appointing about 20, I think it was 21 or 24 new employees for that system. And we have legislators thank us and say we didn't know about this until you wrote about it. And I that is what we are here for. That is the difference that we are trying to make.",
Christina Lords,[01:15:10:02],01:15:32:03,"I will read every one of those types of comments. Because I do think that, you know, if we can actually impact policy and help and give get people, the help they need when they're interacting with government, I think I'm all for that. I think that, we're seeing it now that extremism in Idaho is something that we all need to do a better job of covering.",
Christina Lords,[01:15:32:13],01:16:05:20,"I think we've tried to just pretend that this is on the far right of the spectrum, that it's the fringes, that they don't have the voting blocks to to make a difference in the legislature and on school boards and city councils. But I'm here to tell you that that is changing. And if we don't address, you know, extremism, white supremacy, racism, entering our politics, then we're going to be a hurting unit when it comes to our state, in the next 5 to 10 years, I really, genuinely believe now is the moment to really double down on some of our coverage of this.",education
Christina Lords,[01:16:05:20],01:16:30:09,"And I think the Coeur d'Alene incident this weekend really opened my eyes to some of that. I think we want to walk around and pretend that this isn't us, this isn't our state, this isn't who we are, but people out there perceive this as a safe haven for these folks, and we have to do a better job of saying and showing that this is not who we are, that this is not what we want here, that these are not the type of policies that we will accept as Idahoans.",
Bill Manny,[01:16:30:11],01:16:33:16,"Clint, same question to you.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:16:34:01],01:17:02:24,"Well, I, I completely agree with what Kristina has to say. I think that, you know, it's it's incredibly important that, you know, what what we do, you know, every single day is make our place better and our products better and our communities better, period. But, you know, as I look at what I'm most proud of, personally, I think the way we covered Covid, for two years, basically 18 months, really, was all about localizing it.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:17:03:00],01:17:22:03,"And we made that decision right away. In the beginning, you can get the international national coverage of Covid anywhere else. And, you know, that's not our that's not our, hedgehog, if you want to call it Dan Collins. I think there's debris. But, you know, what we did is we really tried to look at how it was affecting our community locally.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:17:22:05],01:17:52:17,"This was a very unique part of the country for that as well. Suddenly, you know, when the, sheltering was over and we were all, led out of, you know, quarantine, it displays exploded. You know, there were tourists driving in from everywhere. Our hospitality, sector and entertainment here. Just. But crazy. Now, of course, it reflected in the numbers later, but, you know, those things aside, you know, we wanted to really make sure that we were trying to localize it.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:17:52:17],01:18:22:17,"It'd be different. What's already been set has been set, but, you know, I think that's an excellent point for this evening. But what I so that's what I'm most proud of. But weirdly enough, kind of like, Dan talked about his stories, the biggest story that we wrote. And I just look this up while you're talking that we wrote last year was a stay at home dad, a stay at home dads take on helping his kids get through the Covid crunch and fear and school missing.",education
Clint Schroeder,[01:18:22:17],01:18:43:01,"And it was huge. It literally almost two times every any other local content story that we wrote. And it was, you know, it was just really a human piece, from his point of view. And how he worked with his kids and what, what he felt like that did. So I think it's those things we do a great job on.",
Bill Manny,[01:18:43:03],01:18:55:06,"Well, connecting, connecting human beings to humanity is is always been something that that was successful in journalism done. You know, the, the best story and the and the one that got away.",
Don Day,[01:18:55:08],01:19:06:12,"So I'm, I'm going to say this, I think overall our work, I was just going to see what my most read story was last year because I don't actually know. Oh, there's a Christmas tree getting cut down. That's not my favorite part.",
Bill Manny,[01:19:06:12],01:19:07:02,Of the day.,
Don Day,[01:19:07:08],01:19:27:10,"Yeah, pretty much. No so I think that our work on the housing affordability situation in the Treasure Valley has been really important. There's more we can do. I'm going to say something, and Christine has heard me say this abundant Christine that knows what I'm talking about. She's one of the few people out there that does. We are working on a really significant story that I've had reporters on since January.",
Don Day,[01:19:27:12],01:19:45:06,"That is one of the biggest stories of my career. And I can't tell you what it is yet because it's not done. And I'm hoping really soon. But you're talking about partnerships. It's a story that that we've agreed, if they so choose to let the Capital Sun, run. And I'm really hoping to have that here really quickly.",
Don Day,[01:19:45:06],01:19:48:19,"So the story most proud of isn't done yet, and it's drive me crazy. Okay.",
Bill Manny,[01:19:48:19],01:19:50:08,"That's a cheap shot, Don",cinema
Don Day,[01:19:50:13],01:19:55:11,"It is it is it night, Christine I did an event in April, and I kind of did the same dog and pony show.",
Christina Lords,[01:19:55:16],01:20:00:12,"And I think we should make it clear that it's not Ikea coming or something, so people don't get too excited.",
Don Day,[01:20:00:14],01:20:21:03,"Yeah, well, and it's not, it's something that's, How how do I characterize it? It is something that I think is, is a is a significant problem to put lives at risk. I'll just say that, and it's the one that got away. And I know we have Jane Suggs watching and she'll laugh at this. When I started Boise, the people would ask me two things.",boise
Don Day,[01:20:21:03],01:20:39:01,"When are we getting it in and out, and when are we getting an Ikea? We're not getting Ikea. In and Out, we, my reporter, Autumn Roberts, and I was very proud of her, broke the story of the first location in Meridian. And then about six weeks later and In and Out was proposed in Boise, and we got scooped.",boise
Don Day,[01:20:39:03],01:20:57:09,"And I was really, really mad. Really mad. And that was me that was on me because of my part of the beat. And so, so not. And we we followed the Idaho Statesman, which, which broke it to their credit. And we followed them and we credited them with getting the scoop. But that was my one that got away getting.",
Bill Manny,[01:20:57:09],01:21:01:18,So it's good to know that Don has been humbled at least once.,
Don Day,[01:21:01:20],01:21:03:17,"Oh, lots. Trust me.",
Bill Manny,[01:21:03:19],01:21:37:09,"So we have about eight minutes left and I know we wanted to come back, loop back around to the notion of opinion reporting and I think there's two there's two aspects to this. And I'm going to start with Don. But you know, how opinion, how opinions have influenced the public view of journalism and how opinions have maybe stuck, snuck their way into news reporting and maybe just that understanding the difference between opinion reporting and news reporting and what that meant to the work we do.",
Don Day,[01:21:37:11],01:21:54:02,"There's an old saying and I, there's two versions of this saying. The one that I will quote here is the more polite one, which is opinions are like belly buttons. Everyone has one and they are full of junk. I don't like opinions. We don't run opinion content on Boise tab at all. We did a little bit in the early days.",boise
Don Day,[01:21:55:11],01:22:16:02,"And I just went, this isn't a lane we need to be in. People can get a smorgasbord of opinions on Facebook or Twitter or wherever they want. And so we don't do it. And, it's been really, really good for our brand, really good for our brand. People recognize it, they see it, they say it, they say it back to me.",
Don Day,[01:22:17:07],01:22:21:22,And so we don't we just don't do it. And I don't see.,
Bill Manny,[01:22:21:23],01:22:33:14,"And you say you don't do it, you don't run opinion articles, or you don't let reporters report their opinions, or you keep new stories free of opinion. What do you mean when you say that the.",
Don Day,[01:22:33:15],01:22:52:17,"First two now a news story may have opinion because public officials may express an opinion. They're right. Like so. That's within the news coverage. But as far as what comes from us, you don't hear my opinion. We don't take submitted opinion pieces. We don't run letters to the editor. On rare occasion, I will will will break that.",
Don Day,[01:22:53:01],01:23:16:11,"It's been two years. And it was basically to say, hey, let's let's not put nasty notes on people's cars with California plates. But even that, I honestly, I don't know what it would be. Again. We just don't we don't do it. And it's benefited us because the user, when they see opinion pieces from a news outlet, don't necessarily understand the difference.",
Don Day,[01:23:16:13],01:23:30:13,"And even if it says, and, Bill, I know you used to be the opinion editor at statesman, and I think this dynamic has changed over the last ten years. I don't know that they know the difference between that and news coverage. And so staying out of it has been good for our, our position and brand.",
Bill Manny,[01:23:30:15],01:23:53:06,"I think especially online where things you don't have a special page to turn. Yeah, right. It's hard to tell for your average person. What's opinion and what's not opinion. And of course so much reporting everywhere has included more opinion in it as well. So Christina, how have you guys approached this question?",
Christina Lords,[01:23:53:08],01:24:20:16,"We do run commentary on our website. We do run columns and opinion. They're all right. The occasional opinion column myself. I, I think there's a wide, wide range of the quality of opinion writing that's out there. And I think it's a dying art. Opinion writers and newsrooms used to be the best reporters in the room, because they had to be, because they had to base their opinions on fact.",
Christina Lords,[01:24:20:16],01:24:44:11,"They had to know issues inside and out. They had to know how to anticipate people that disagreed with them. And they were on the phone just as much as reporters talking to officials, getting that information firsthand, those sort of things. And I think we still have those good opinion writers, in the US. And, and in Idaho, I think there's, there's a handful of opinion and opinion writers that do it really well.",
Christina Lords,[01:24:44:13],01:25:08:03,"However, I do think that Don is right, that in 2022, everyone has a platform. So if everyone is an expert, no one is an expert. And when we run opinions, it goes back to what Clint was saying, that people want to be reaffirmed in their beliefs. So if we're just putting things out to either make people elated that they're the smartest person in the room, and I have the opinion and here's the proof.",
Christina Lords,[01:25:08:08],01:25:29:02,"You know, I agree with this person or it's the opposite. Here's a way for me to attack you, your news organization, and what you're writing about. We try very hard. I always put one where I got a call once as an editor, for someone who couldn't understand than an opinion. What? On the physical newspaper opinion page was a column was an opinion.",
Christina Lords,[01:25:29:04],01:25:49:15,"It was labeled even in the even in print. People don't understand it. So throw them onto 17 social media sites and good luck. They don't get it. And so we we try really hard to put commentary in all caps, as the first lead into any, social media post that we do when it comes to our opinion content.",
Christina Lords,[01:25:50:23],01:26:13:17,"It's a, it's a slippery slope out there. I at some point I could see us not doing it. At some point, I think there and Don shared with me that there are news organizations, large national chains that are ratcheting down, their opinion content output. And I can see the argument for that. I, I think we all know people that are close to us and people that we haven't seen since sixth grade.",education
Christina Lords,[01:26:13:17],01:26:37:11,"We all know their opinions on everything at this point. And so do we really need that in our products when when I know how my sixth grade best friend feels about abortion, gun rights, school shootings, you know who's going to be governor, you name it. I know that, and I haven't seen her in 20 years, you know, so it's just like at some point, we've got to that really, really good opinion.",education
Christina Lords,[01:26:37:11],01:26:42:10,Writers do their thing and I think get out of the way for the rest. But that's how I feel.,
Bill Manny,[01:26:42:12],01:26:53:20,"I know, Clint, you were talking about, I think it was Jeanette has made some, decisions on how it's going to treat opinion reporting in its newspapers. So how how is it playing out there in Court Lane?",
Clint Schroeder,[01:26:53:22],01:27:21:19,"Well, I, you know, you made reference to the Poynter Institute, put this out on the eighth. I just just looked up again. But it says that Gannett scuttling their editorial pages, in 250, titled Shane Regional papers. And, you know, when I read that, you know, given the date that it came out, you know, three days, before this last weekend, with all this stuff going on, you know, it just really resonated that, you know, hey, we really kind of need to look at this and then discuss this with you guys.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:27:21:21],01:27:42:20,"You know, you were talking about Christina, that they have to be the best writer in the room. They also have to have the toughest skin because these guys are taking a beating, you know, for their opinion. And, you know, it's interesting because I, you know, it's one of those things that I'm still percolating, I guess. But as as I look forward, all of your comments are correct.",literature
Clint Schroeder,[01:27:42:20],01:28:06:09,"I mean, there there are a million different places that I can go to read exactly what I agree with. And, you know, if it's black and white news, like, you know, there was a fire downtown, you know, here the details, blah, blah, blah. You know, that's one thing. But for a newspaper to try to set the record straight and try to it's almost it almost becomes a lecture.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:28:06:09],01:28:32:05,"Right? Because it doesn't reflect necessarily the tone of the community sometimes. And, and I, I'm really struggling with that because I do think that it doesn't help our readership. I especially when we take a hard stand, you know, that that maybe counter counter community or counter current culture. I feel like there's, there's room for damage at that point.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:28:32:07],01:28:55:08,"So you know where I am. We do take, we do have an opinion. Right now, it's, 3 or 4 days a week. In most of our, our main papers, we also have letters to the editor on the same day. Letters to the editor, I think are one thing that's, you know, that's letting the readers really weigh in, you know, and share with other people, you know, and maybe even guest opinion.",
Clint Schroeder,[01:28:55:17],01:29:20:07,"I, I would agree with, too. I just think right now, in the world we live in, we're not saying anything new. We're not necessarily educating, an audience that that can't otherwise, or hasn't otherwise come across that information. And if it hurts us, or hurts our advertising or hurts our readers, what? I just don't know that we need to take those hard stance.",
Bill Manny,[01:29:21:10],01:29:42:12,"Well, this has been a fascinating conversation, and I think we can go for another 90 minutes with the three of you. So I've really enjoyed getting this chance to talk to you. I want to thank Clint Schroeder. I want to thank Christina, Lourdes and Don Day for participating in this conversation. I want to thank Margaret Johnson, the, Humanities Council chairwoman, for, hosting us.",
Bill Manny,[01:29:42:12],01:30:05:17,"And the staff at the Humanities Council did a great job putting together the series and, the art, the the ASL and Spanish language interpreters who have made this, more accessible to other viewers. I want to thank them as well. So, you can tell your friends if they missed this, they can, see the replays of both of our conversations at, the Humanities Council website.",
Bill Manny,[01:30:05:19],01:30:18:04,"And I want to thank you all. Good night. Thank you all. And say good night. And see you next time. Thanks again. Thanks, you guys, for having us.",
